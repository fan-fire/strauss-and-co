NV richly woven, with layered glacé pineapple, caramel, citrus peel and toasted hazelnuts; vast 260 g/l sugar is uncloying, with lovely freshness, piquancy and length at just 11% alcohol. A Bacchanalian masterpiece, deserved recipient of the inaugural Dessert Wine of the Year award.'</i> - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 5*</p><p><i>   ‘The Non-Vintage Olerasay is a solera made from oxidized Mullineux Straw Wine between 2008 and 2014 - two barrels held back to top up each year and it will only be released in years when it is felt to be superior to the straw wine. It delivers 268 grams per liter of residual sugar. It has a captivating nose with Barsac-like barley sugar, honey and marmalade with very little signs of oxidation. The palate is smooth and utterly harmonious, extraordinarily pure with perfect acidity, and sensual with honey, mandarin, peach and a touch of brown sugar on the long finish. It is the harmony here that grabs you - almost effortless. Stunning. It is not the most unctuous wine, the most powerful and ostentatious, yet that precision in the finish is bewitching and worthy of what I think to date might the highest score I have ever awarded to a South African wine.'</i> – Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 99/100 (Apr 2017 )</p><p><i>    'A solera straw wine, made from seven different vintages and three vineyards, this is one
of the Cape’s greatest ever sweet wines. Boasting 260 grams of sugar, it’s rich and exotic,

The 375ml bottle was examined over the course of two weeks during which time it barely changed. Each time I put it under a microscope looking for a fault. I never found one. Golden in colour, it has an intoxicating bouquet with orange sorbet, quince, lemon verbena and a very slight Aszú-like note that hovers in the background. Having recently tasted plenty of Sauternes, I can’t help noticing how the aromatics are unencumbered by a thick cloak of oak, thereby lending the bouquet brightness and vividness that is totally enthralling. This all translates across to the crystalline palate. The perfect seam of acidity cuts like an ancient Samurai sword through the viscous fruit whose purity is off the charts. This electrifying Olerasay does not mess about – it immediately thrills the senses with its mélange of blood orange, apricot, crushed minerals and passion fruit. There is so much energy in this wine. The finish has a weightless quality that means, despite its high residual sugar level, the wine is actually easy to drink and is not weighed down by its own unctuousness. The killer aspect of this is the soupçon of bitter orange that hits the back of the throat. I suspected that a perfect Olerasay was possible after the first iteration. This is it.
