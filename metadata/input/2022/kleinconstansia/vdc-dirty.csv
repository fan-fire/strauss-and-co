Vin de Constance;1986;500ml;1;;"<p><em>&lsquo;Intense, lifted, fresh honey and lemon bouquet. Racy, minerally acid lends vivid clarity to the rich fruit, silky texture. Excellent balance. Incisively clean, long. Amazingly youthful.&rsquo;&nbsp;</em> Angela Lloyde<br /><br /><em>&lsquo;Startling caramelised orange nose, smoky, a touch of rancio, vivid. Medium bodied, moderate concentration, good acidity, a trace of oxidation, yet vibrant, with some tropical fruit. Peppery finish, fine length.&rsquo;</em> Stephen Brook, Decanter magazine.</p>"
Vin de Constance;1987;500ml;1;;"<p><i>'The first commercially sold vintage of the modern era is superb and rigid. Raisined fruit softness, with salted caramels and coffee.

<p><em>&lsquo;1986, limited bottling of unfortified replica of fabled 18th century dessert Constantias of Hendrick Cloete. Made every year at Klein Constantia since 1986 from Muscat de Frontignan &ndash; same clone selection as originally imported from western France by Governor Jan van Riebeeck in 1656. 1987 deeper coloured than 1986, more alcoholic at 15% cf. 14%, more mellifluous, more amply endowed with range of apricot-honey scents. Small barrel-aged, in newer oak than in historic bottlings. In Cloete&rsquo;s day, stems of bunches twisted when ripe and left to hang on vine, sugar and flavour concentration intensified by evaporation, leading to natural alcohols of up to 17%. Gower gets same result by halving the crop.</em> &ndash; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide (1992)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Wonderfully balanced, with limey freshness, nutty complexity and dabs of tropical fruit. A true legend that is still very much alive today.&rsquo;</em> &ndash; Roland Peens, 96 points (2018)</p>"
Vin de Constance;1988;500ml;1;;"<p><strong><i>&lsquo;</i></strong><i>Brooding, dark, smoky notes. This is evolved, but stable. Much drier than the 1987, the &rsquo;88 is better suited as an aperitif than dessert wine. A firm acid backbone and saline centre holds intact. Good condition.</i>&rsquo; &ndash; Higgo Jacobs 2020, 92/100</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Hugely complex on nose with Muscat fragrance, spice, white mushroom and some nuttiness, while the palate showed great focus and freshness. In terms of flavour, an almost peppery intensity before a long, saline finish.</i>&rsquo; &ndash; Christian Eedes, Winemag.co.za 18/20 (2011)</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>The 1988 Vin de Constance has a deep nutty color. The nose is fully mature but beautifully defined with lifted Muscat notes augmented by hazelnut, marmalade and a touch of mint. The palate is medium-bodied with a bright, citric entry with hints of rosewater, quince, orange zest and dried apricot. It is very focused and full of tension on the finish although to be honest, I cannot envisage it improving further and I would gladly drink any bottles I had sooner rather than later.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;<i>&ndash;&nbsp;</i>Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 88/100 (2013)</p>"
Vin de Constance;1989;500ml;1;;"<p>&lsquo;<i>Offers a lovely amber color, with blood orange, bitter almond, clove, green tea and dried persimmon notes backed by a noticeably spicy Muscat hint on the finish.

Vin de Constance;1991;500ml;1;;"<p>&lsquo;<i>One of the Cape&rsquo;s few cult wines - justified as much as inherent individuality as its icon status with the British - UK visitors to the Cape can be identified by the number of cases of Constance in their luggage</i>. &ldquo; &ndash; Platter's SA Wine Guide 1996, 5*</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Part of a wine legitimately taking on icon status is that it should impress most times it is drunk and the Vin de Constance 1991 from Klein Constantia didn&rsquo;t disappoint yesterday. Deep brown in colour, it nevertheless had fantastic aromatics and flavour &ndash; dried flowers, mint humbug, caramel, mushroom, a certain loaminess. Intricate and wonderfully balanced &ndash; nothing obvious or aggressive about it. A special treat.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;&ndash; Christian Eedes, Winemag.co.za 95/100 (2014)</p>"
Vin de Constance;1992;500ml;1;;"<p><i>&lsquo;Nuts, Christmas spices, oranges and starfruit &ndash; delicious citric spritz. Caramel, cream, lemon, lime, orange, preserved tropical fruits.

<p>&lsquo;<i>The 1996 Vin de Constance is has a lucid amber hue. The nose is very engaging: marmalade, seaweed, quince, frangipane and a touch of chlorine &ndash; more like a mature Barsac than mature Sauternes. The palate is medium-bodied with a restrained viscous entry of mandarin, orange rind and quince. It is nicely focused and precise, even if it does not quite possess the delineation of the 2007 and 2008 on the finish. Very fine</i>.&rsquo; &ndash; Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 94/100 (Oct 2013)</p>"

<p><i>&lsquo;The 2009 Vin de Constance Natural Sweet Wine had been in bottle around six weeks when I tasted it at the estate. It was harvested over three months from 25 separate batches, each bunch selected by hand and raised for six months to one year in 500-liter barrels. Matthew told me that he is looking for less time in barrel and more time in bottle before release. Then again, the 2003 is still in barrel! This is the first vintage Matthew Day has been involved with from start to finish and he sees it as a cross between the 2007 and 2008. It has an intense marmalade, dried apricot, beeswax and honeycomb scents, your quintessential Vin de Constance nose, and it seems to muster more vigor with aeration. The palate is well-balanced with a spicy tincture on the entry, slightly oxidative, with nutty notes infusing the thickly layered honeyed fruit with touches of papaya and mango toward the finish with touches of rosewater and gripe water (a children's medicine for anyone without the privilege) on the aftertaste. Another superb Vin de Constance from Matthew Day.&rsquo;</i> - Neal Martin, Robertparker.com, 94/100 (2014)</p>"

Also in magnum.’ - Platter’s SA Wine Guide 2018, 5* (99/100) ‘The 2013 Vin de Constance Natural Sweet Wine was matured in 500-liter barrels for around 36 months. It has a beautiful bouquet with honey, quince, pressed yellow flowers and Mirabelle. It has wonderful definition and purity. The palate is very well balanced with a mellifluous texture and beautifully judged acidity as it just sashays along. It fans out on the finish with honey, quince, a touch of rhubarb and ginger, extraordinarily persistent in the mouth. Matthew Day, current winemaker, opined that he thought the 2012 would be the best ever, but the freshness might see it overtaken. This is awesome.’ - Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 96/100 (Apr 2017)

The latest, world-class release of Vin de Constance certainly doesn’t lack sweetness at 165 grams or even concentration, but it has a freshness that's reminiscent of Vouvray or Barsac.

Bravo! 2022-35.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020 - Overall Sweet Wine of the Year, 98/100 ‘Lustrous mid gold. Dried apricot, orange blossom and citrus peels on the nose, suffused with nutmeg, clove and coffee cream, and an earthy, spicy, saffron-like note.
