Series C;2003;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&lsquo;A fairly big (14.5% alcohol), chewy wine, but one that delivers waves of lush fruit. Plum and cassis notes are framed by hints of smoke and cedar; the merest hint of green herbs adds complexity without detracting. Long and supple on the finish.&rsquo;</em> - Wine Enthusiast, 92/100 (Nov 2005)</p>
<p><em>'The &lsquo;C&rsquo; is for Cabernet Sauvignon, whose structure and power inform the masterly Bordeaux blend. It&rsquo;s dark-berried opulence is still swaddled in youthfully dense and austere tannins. One for the patient - should evolve into something majestic. 82% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. 54% new French oak for 18 months.'</em>- Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2006, 4.5*</p>"
Series C;2004;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&lsquo;Clearly Cabernet led (52%), which the name implies: more austere, imposing than the Series M, though influential 35% Merlot adds sweet-fruited mid-palate flesh. &lsquo;04 has a serious tannin grip but also verve and freshness to balance the riper style, ensuring ageing potential. Seasoned with Cabernet Franc and Malbec (9/4%). Seamlessly polished by 19 months in&nbsp; &plusmn;70% new barriques. IWC gold.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5*</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Series C is the Cabernet-dominated version of a wine that brings together the winemaking talents of California winemaker Zelma Long and her viticulturist husband Phil Freese, along with Warwick Estate's Mike Ratcliffe and San Francisco-based importer Bartholemew Broadbent. Coffee, chocolate and dark berry fruits dominate this brooding wine that shows intensity and power. Yet it never becomes heavy or overripe&mdash;here there is a good sense of balance that lifts the wine, especially in the aftertaste.&rsquo;</em> - Roger Voss, Wine Enthusiast, 94/100 (Nov 2006)</p>"
Series C;2005;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&ldquo;Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, as name implies (66%, with 22% Merlot, 6% each Malbec and Cabernet Franc), in this powerful but seamless and polished red; &rsquo;05 rich, scented, resolute but ripe tannins, harmonious oaking (90% new French)&rdquo;</em> - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2008, 4.5*</p>
<p><em>'Still tight, but with impressive concentration and precision to the layers of plum, red currant, roasted vanilla, espresso bean and mineral. Focused, almost sleek on the finish, with fine length. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. This young project from Mike Ratcliffe (Warwick Estate) and Zelma Long is getting better every year.' - </em>James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (Feb 2009)</p>"
Series C;2006;750ml;6;;"<p>&lsquo;<i>Harmonious 2006 Cabernet-led blend, with 40% Merlot and splash Cabernet Franc for aromatic lift. Compact, ripe polished blackcurrant and plum fruit currently masked by resolute but seamless tannins, long finish. 95% new Fr oak</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2009, 5*</p>
<p><em>'This is concentrated and winey, but nicely integrated already, with briar, blackberry, mulled currant, black tea and dark cocoa notes all gliding through the sleek, fine-grained finish, where a perfumy hint lingers. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc'.</em> - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (Jun 2010)</p>"
Series C;2007;750ml;6;;"<p><em>'Rich and lush, but very driven, with gorgeous fig bread, linzer torte, bittersweet ganache and mulled currant fruit flavors, all backed by hints of black tea, graphite and spice. The long finish lets everything hang together nicely. Impressive. The best vintage yet for this quietly and steadily improving project. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.'</em> -&nbsp; James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 93/100 (Nov 2010)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Polished, authoritative 2007 Bordeaux blend exhibits Merlot succulence and delightful herbal Cabernet Franc aromatics. Savoury Cabernet Sauvignon (74%) tannins provide a structured platform for abundant layers of dense black fruit, with a tight mineral centre. Includes splash of Malbec. 25 months in 94% new French oak.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2011, 4.5*</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;A beautifully balanced and nuanced wine. The aromas are heady and thick but still vibrant, displaying juicy notes of black cherry, black raspberry sauce and semi-dried fig laced with accents of bittersweet chocolate, tobacco and white pepper. The texture is like crushed satin, with well-integrated tannins and a creamy mouthfeel. Touches of licorice root and smoky cedar spice augment the dark fruit on the lengthy finish.&rsquo;</em> - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 93/100 (Mar 2011)</p>"
Series C;2008;750ml;6;;‘The 2008 Series C shows more grip and bruising structure than previous vintages of the Cabernet-based blend, with gripping tannins framing the hugely concentrated and heady blackberry, boysenberry and deep plum flavors. Tight and firm in the mouth, complex backnotes of black licorice, cigar tobacco and crushed African violet petals appear once the structure subsides and remain through the very long close.’ - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 93/100 (Nov 2011)  ‘Raised for 22 months in 80% new French oak, the 2008 Series C is a blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 6% Malbec. It is already showing great lift and freshness on the nose with more red fruit character than the 2007, doubtless due to the higher percentage of Merlot. There is also a floral component that is not evident in earlier vintages. The palate is very well balanced with lush ripe red-berried fruit that is beautifully integrated with the oak, with caressing tannins on the velvety dark plum and creme de cassis infused finish. This is a simply delicious wine that will put a smile on your face.’ - Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 93/100 (Aug 2011)
Series C;2009;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&ldquo;...dark chocolate and vanilla, demonstrating great precision on the finish with a hint of cappuccino on the aftertaste. This is superb. I have a lot of respect for the superlative Vilafont&eacute; wines, where Zelma Long is at the helm, and their pair of 2009s do not disappoint. "" -</em> Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Sept 2012)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Standout, succulent Bordeaux blend, with amply oaked super-ripe fruit a hallmark, always Cabernet-dominated. 2009 (54% plus Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Malbec) rich, textured and spicy, the Cabernet Franc adding lift.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2012, 4.5*</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;This stunning wine is still quite young and shut-down on the nose, taking its time in the glass to truly begin to open up. Once it does, scents of licorice root, chicory, cassis and black plum fill the bouquet. The mouthfeel is bold and powerful, with gripping tannins that coat the palate and support the dense black-fruit core. Accents of black-tea leaves and sweet spice grace the long finish.&rsquo;</em> - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 93/100 (Jan 2013)</p>"
Series C;2010;750ml;6;;"<p><i>'A ripe, flavoursome Cabernet-based blend (hence C) with lesser amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this takes its inspiration from Australia and California rather than Bordeaux. Rich, oaky and flirting with over-ripeness, it's a bold statement of a wine with lots of sweet, fleshy plum and blackberry fruit. Drink 2015-22' - </i>Tim Atkin, SA Wine Report 2013, 93/100</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Intense black fruit aromas, cassis and almond notes on plush and concentrated 2010 - Cabernet-dominated as always, with 25% Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Malbec. Opulent, brocaded textures and real mid-palate weight are defining features of this iconically styled wine, a near clone to super-rich, finely balanced 2009.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2013, 4.5*</p>
<p>&lsquo;<em>The bouquet of this wine is immediately full and lush, with aromas of brambly blackberry, cassis, crushed violet and cocoa-dusted raspberry. The flavors are similarly ripe and juicy on the palate, but don't taste overly so, with rich notes of black cherry, berry and toasted sweet spice. The texture is round yet structured, with medium tannins that linger through the finish.&rsquo;</em> - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 92/100 (Jul 2014)</p>"
Series C;2011;750ml;6;;"<p><i>'Seductive Bordeaux blend, Cabernet-based as name hints, with Merlot and Malbec (26/14), drops 10&rsquo;s Cabernet Franc in and concentrated 11 (5*). Classic claret markers and ripe cassis, graphite and spice (courtesy 80% new oak). Smoothly delicious now and more so given time.'</i> &ndash; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2015, 5*</p>
<p><i>'Very dense, with a loamy hint backing the core of licorice snap, black currant paste and warm fig fruit. This shows ample grip but remains polished and integrated, while espresso and black tea accents fill out the finish. Impressive. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc... 541 cases made.</i> '&ndash; Wine Spectator &nbsp;93/100 (2014)</p>
<p><i>'The 2011 Series C was apparently the shortest vintage in history with warm days and cool nights. It is a blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% merlot, 14% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc, aged for 22 months in new and used barrels. There is a tangible &ldquo;coolness&rdquo; on the nose: not as intense of as exuberant as the previous two vintages, but replete with fine blackberry, autumn leave and mineral scents, suggesting a higher percentage of Cabernet than there actually is. The palate is medium-bodied with a supple entry. This is rounded and smooth with greater depth that the nose suggests. Here the Merlot plays a more conspicuous role than on the nose, fleshing and rounding out the finish that is harmonious and long. Very fine</i>.' &ndash; Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 92/100 (2014)</p>"
Series C;2012;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&lsquo;A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Malbec, 19% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, spicy aromas of leather, black pepper, savory herbs, licorice and Mexican chocolate lead the nose. It's grounded by a solid fruit core of blackberry, boysenberry and mulberry fruit, lending a supporting spine to the toasted spice and earthy accents. Well balanced, with velvety tannins and a long, evolving finish, drink this lush, velvety red from 2018&ndash;2024.&rsquo;</em> - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 94/100 (Jan 2015)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;A four-way blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is another more restrained style from Vilafont&eacute;. Mint, fresh herbs, sweet plum and cassis fruit, textured tannins and a firm, rigorous finish that suggests the wine will age well. Drink: 2016-25.&rsquo;</em> - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2015, 94/100</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, as name hints, with Malbec and Merlot, and 7% Cabernet Franc in 2012 versus none in 2011. Classic aromas and flavours - blackcurrant, graphite and cedarwood spice. Balanced, for early drinking after decanting for an hour or 2; will also reward a decade+ cellaring.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2016, 4.5*</p>"
Series C;2013;750ml;6;; 
Series C;2014;750ml;6;;"‘Sumptuous quartet of Bordeaux varieties led by Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), 2014 gets more new oak (70%, 22 months) than sibling yet retains fruit purity and poise; shows superb tannic grip, perfumed cedarwood persistence which will see it through the next decade or more. 1.5 & 3L bottled for future release.’ - Platter’s SA Wine Guide 2018, 4.5* (92/100)  ‘Cabernet rules the blend here - hence C - with support from Merlot, Malbec and a splash of Cabernet Franc. This is a dense, serious, stylish, age worthy cuvée that deserves its cult following. Structured, spicy and winningly oaked, with a core of refreshing black fruit. 2019-26.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2017, 96/100  ‘The 2014 Series C is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 6% Cabernet Franc, matured in 70% new French oak for 22 months. Deep in color, in my opinion it has a superior bouquet compared to the Series M this vintage: very well defined with gorgeous black cherry and blueberry fruit, the oak seamlessly integrated even though it will need 3-4 years to fully integrate. The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and velvety in texture with finely tuned acidity, nicely poised and gently fanning out with a fresh blackberry and bilberry finish, white pepper and clove lingering on the aftertaste. This is one of the most refined vintages of Series C that I have tasted.’ - Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Apr 2017)"
Series C;2015;750ml;6;;"<p><em>&lsquo;Dense yet refined Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec (19/15/9), 2015 deserves lengthy cellaring, 22 months in French oak (67% new) adding to structure, poise and persistent cedarwood perfume.&rsquo;</em> - Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2019, 4.5* (94/100)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;C stands for Cabernet Sauvignon, which never represents less than half of the blend. The brilliant 2015 has 19% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec, but it&rsquo;s Cabernet Sauvignon that provides the backbone. Rich, structured and serious, with lots of cigar box perfume, fine-boned tannins and considerable potential. 2022-30.&rsquo;</em> - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2018, 96/100</p>"
Series C;2016;750ml;6;;‘Refined, ageworthy Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend with Merlot, Malbec, and Cabernet Franc (15/12/11), 2016 less dense, more elegant than previous. Black-fruit intensity and length, also dark chocolate and pencil shavings from 22 months in 77% new French oak.’ - Platter’s SA Wine Guide 2020, 4.5* (93/100)    ‘Series C seemed to cope a little better with the heat of the 2016 vintage than its stablemate Series M, partly because it's Cabernet Sauvignon based with 15% Merlot and only 12% of less stable Malbec. With flavours of liquorice, plum and blackberry, this is a layered, well-structured red with impressive concentration, fine oak and granular tannins. 2021-28.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2019, 96/100     ‘A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec, the 2016 Series C has sweet oak on the nose with spiced blackberry and blueberry compote. The wine is expressive with generous dark fruits, bitter chocolate and Christmas spice. Full-bodied, it has a broad-shouldered, rich and juicy finish. This is very Napa-esque with its juiciness and high complexity. Well done! It is delicious.’ - Anthony Mueller, Wine Advocate, 94+/100 (Oct 2019)
Series C;2017;750ml;6;;‘Fully justifying owner Mike Ratcliffe's praise for the 2017 vintage, Series C is Cabernet Sauvignon based with 21% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. Aged in 70% new wood, it's serious, toasty and plush with smooth tannins, bramble, plum, cassis and black fig flavours, fresh acidity and very fine, ageworthy tannins. 2022-29.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020, 96/100    ‘The 2017 Series C is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec matured in 70% French oak for 22 months. It has an opulent, beautifully controlled yet sensual bouquet featuring layers of precise black cherry, blackberry, cedar and violet scents. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe, juicy tannins. A voluminous and extravagant Series C whose smooth, velvety, almost creamy finish manages to avoid cloying. Made in a California more than Bordeaux vein, with a 20-year lifespan.’ - Neal Martin, Vinous, 94/100 (Apr 2021)   ‘The Series C 2017 displays an incredibly deep, dark broody garnet-purple colour with imposing extract and concentration. On the nose, this youthful release is a little closed to begin with but opens up in the glass offering alluring notes of incense, sweet vanilla pod, caramelised cashew nuts, black berry reduction, juniper berry and dusty, graphite tinged black chocolate exoticism. The palate is velvety and supple with a most generous, multi-layered mouthfeel of blueberry, black cherries, saline cassis and a charcoal tinged buttered brown toasty finish. Where the 2015 release showed a more masculine power, the 2017 is the personification of intensity with elegance, finesse and grace. A producer can wait decades to realise a vintage like this that possesses this degree of poise, intensity and weightless concentration combined with a decadently fruited complexity and composure. A spellbinding new release from Vilafonté. Indulge yourself by drinking a few bottles in its youth, however the 2017 is certainly worthy of over a decade or more of cellaring to realise its full potential.’ - Greg Sherwood MW, Fine Wine Safari, 96+/100 (Oct 2019)
Series C;2018;750ml;6;;‘Sold at more than twice the price of the Series M for reasons of demand alone, this is a suitably Californian style from Chris de  Vries and West Coast co-owner Zelma Long. Combining Cabernet Sauvignon with 44% Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, it's at the glossy, ripe, polished end of the spectrum, with 70% new coffee bean oak and graphite on the nose, fig, orange peel and blackcurrant fruit, layered, enveloping tannins and a balanced finish. 2023- 28.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2021, 95/100     ‘Beginning impeccably balanced and generous on the nose, the 2018 Series C is wrapped in elegant baking spices from the almost 70% new French oak. A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 14% Malbec and 11% Cabernet Franc, the wine bursts with finesse, precision, elegance and juicy dark fruit. Full-bodied, the Series C boasts juicy blackberry essence, notes of black raspberry cobbler, toasted pie crust and cedar cigar box in the mouth, with pure balance, fine-grained tannins, succulent acidity and a mineral tension across the mid-palate. It ends with a long, winding finish that evolves with persistence. This vintage marks another successful bottling. The only downside is that only 36 barrels were made. This is highly collectible stuff!’ - Anthony Mueller, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Feb 2021)
Series C;2019;750ml;6;;‘The Series C 2019 is a blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Franc that was aged for 22 months in 74% new French oak barriques with the remainder aged in older, multiple passage barrels. A deep ruby-purple colour, this really is an impressively intense and striking blend that is seductive and alluring from the moment the cork is pulled. The aromatics offer glimpses of black cherries, earthy stewed black plums, black currants, fertile loam, tilled earth, freshly cut hedgerow together with hints of hoisin plum sauce and melted chocolate nuances. The palate is medium to full bodied but incredibly pure and polished with a confident, approachable accessibility, sleek rounded tannins and layer upon layer of seamless creamy black berry fruits, saline liquorice, sweet cedar spice and a subtle blueberry accent on the vibrant fresh finish. This wine does not try and hide its sweet seductive black fruits yet there is certainly a subtle subtext of earthy, stony minerality that runs in unison with all the vivid fruit concentration. A deliciously accomplished wine.’ - Greg Sherwood MW, Fine Wine Safari, 96+/100 (Oct 2021)
