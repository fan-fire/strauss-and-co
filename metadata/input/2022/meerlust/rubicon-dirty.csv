Rubicon;1984;750ml;1;FS004 - 634870;"<p><em>&lsquo;In an increasingly crowded field of local excellence, this remains among the top South African claret blends; consistently elegant, medium-bodied, carefully oaked, restrained but perfumed, with some classic, minerally, claret undertones. A ripe vegetal/herbal nuance is often apparent, with dried tea leaf associations. A medium-length finish, in a routinely medium-strength wine. The '84, undoubtedly one of the best vintages, was, for well-known French shipper Paul Bouchard, ""the finest French claret outside France"". Meerlust Rubicons are not big, plummy over-oaked or over-done New World or Californian creations. The aim has been not so much to attack the nostrils, with an upfront bouquet of raw cedary oak, but to go for elegant complexity on the palate.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 1990, 5*</p>"

Rubicon;2012;750ml;6;7594 - 512145;"<p><em>'Really elegant with lovely depth and fine aromatics. Some toasty oak evident as well as slight sweet sour, savoury notes. Firm tannin and acidity with long finish. Drink now to 2030' -</em> Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100</p>
<p><em>'Incredible purity. Completely open-knit and generous, but also beautifully elegant and appetising. Cherries, pomegranate, flint and pot-pourri perfume overlayed on a sleek palate. This is one of the underrated Cape vintages of the post-2000 era, revealing ever more composure and elegance with age. For those with preference of the less ripe vintages.'</em>&nbsp;- Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 95/100</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Superlative&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;sensational&rsquo; are common epithets for this flagship cab-dominated (&plusmn;60%) Bordeaux blend. Lithe 2013 &amp; sleek 2012 take up the baton of 2010 (5 stars, 98 pts) after 2011 not made. Plush, the dark fruit integrates the oak influence (65% new, 20 months) within complex, dense structure. For the long haul.'</em>- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2017, 4.5*</p>"

<p><em>&lsquo;Meerlust&rsquo;s top red is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot as the chorus. It&rsquo;s a frm, serious, almost austere red that&rsquo;s clearly built to age. I&rsquo;d like a little more fruit on the tannic bones, but this is well made in a traditional style.&rsquo;</em> - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2016, 90/100</p>"
