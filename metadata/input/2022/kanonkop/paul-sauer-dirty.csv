Paul Sauer;2000;750ml;1;;"<p><i>&lsquo;Great character in this throwback wine, with a thicket of dark currant, blackberry, tar, beef, chestnut, mineral and sanguine flavors. Long finish is etched with bittersweet chocolate and another layer of really ripe blackberry fruit. Impressive.

Paul Sauer;2001;750ml;1;;"<p><em>""Fine Bordeaux-style blend, one of few undoubted Cape classics - with recent years showing modern touches to classicism. Vinified traditionally in open fermenters. 01's 64% Cabernet less than usual 80%; with equal amounts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. From first sniff, obvious claims to illustrious lineage: violets, tea-leaf, blackberries, presented subtly and superbly. Finely structured and balanced palate, strongly elegant, with succulent acidity and silky tannins, plentiful understated fruit. 26 months new French oak will knit. Few more years will bring harmony, heralding rewarding lengthy maturity""</em>&nbsp;- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2005, 4.5*</p>"
Paul Sauer;2002;750ml;1;;"64% Cabernet Sauvignon and equal amounts Merlot and Cabernet Franc in lesser vintage '02, also good and serious, long-flavoured  but less subtuously fruited, more severe, with big dry tannins. 2 years in French oak. WO Simonsberg-Stellenbosch.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2006, 4.5*<p><i>'Quite ripe and rather full, with a nice velvety feel to the dark plum, mashed currant and fig paste notes, all laced with maduro tobacco and bittersweet cocoa hints. The muscular finish has an iron hint buried. Much better than on release, when it had an inconsistent showing.

Paul Sauer;2003;750ml;1;;"<p>2003 is considered among the best Cape vintages post the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>A classic since 1981: has Cape character plus international sophistication. Vinified traditionally, like all these, in open fermenters. 03&rsquo;s 63% Cabernet Sauvignon in line with previous, but just 6% Merlot, rest Cabernet Franc. Dominated in youth by oak and spicy tobacco, but rich fruit lurking: deserves at least half-decade maturation for violets, tea-leaf, black berries to play full role within firm, ripe structure.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;&ndash; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5*</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;(63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc and 6% Merlot) Medium ruby-red. Explosive aromas of blackberry, violet, iron, graphite, meat, leather and licorice, all lifted by a floral note. Sweet, dense and silky, with highly concentrated candied fruit flavors and superb inner-palate verve. Complicating notes of tar and forest floor. Finishes firmly tannic and very long. An outstanding vintage for this South African classic.&nbsp;</i>&ndash; Stephen Tanzer, Vinous,  92+/100 (March 2007)</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>The 2003 Kanonkop Paul Sauer Stellenbosch has the highest percentage of Cabernet Franc used to date (31%) with 6% Merlot and 63% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a very refined bouquet, very pure, with star-anise-tinged black fruit with hints of bell pepper and tertiary notes emerging with time. The palate has an understated entry with a slightly grainy texture: blackberry, black olive, a touch of menthol and dried orange rind toward the finish. This is drinking now, but will continue to evolve over 15 to 20 years.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;<i>&ndash;&nbsp;</i>Neal Martin, Wine Advocate (October 2014), 91/100</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>This is solid, with mature hints of cedar and tobacco now weaving through the core of red currant, damson plum and red licorice. A nice briary edge frames the tangy finish.

Paul Sauer;2004;750ml;1;;A classic since 1981. '04 has 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, with equal amounts Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

Paul Sauer;2005;750ml;1;;"<p><i>&lsquo;The 2005 Paul Sauer offers an exuberant bouquet with dried prune, licorice, a touch of caramel and fig that just soars from the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a harmonious, focused opening. The tannins lend the 2005 a firm structure, but there is plenty of fruit to back it up and the finish fans out with luscious licorice, sea salt and black fruits that linger. Superb.

<p>&lsquo;<i>Features a core of dark plum, cassis and blackberry fruit offset by a floral anise notes.

Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Best from 2014 through 2020.</i>&rsquo; &ndash; Wine Spectator (October 2013), 92/100</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;At a time when a lot of the so-called old guard are rapidly being outpaced, outflanked by the new generation of winemakers who have travelled overseas and introduced a more thoughtful approach to their craft, Kanonkop are a testament to fact that some of the country&rsquo;s stalwarts can remain at the top of their game. Many producers merely pay lip service to the notion of finesse, but at Kanonkop that is evident where it matters &ndash; in the glass. So kudos to owners Johann and Paul Krige and especially to winemaker Abrie Beeslaar, installed at Kanonkop since 2002, for all their hard work. What I found interesting was Abrie&rsquo;s conviction that Kanonkop has remained true to what it does, ignoring fads and fashions, merely fine-tuning its style. I have to say that over the last ten years their wines have attained a greater degree of refinement and purity, therefore something must have changed! What distinguishes Kanonkop is both the enviable age of some of its vine stock, especially its Pinotage, and the corollary of longevity. These are wines that are probably drunk way too early by consumers, although I can understand why. Chuck two or three bottles in your cellar and leave them for 20 years &ndash; you will be amazed at what you will find.&rsquo; -&nbsp;</i>Neal Martin, Wine Advocate</p>"
Paul Sauer;2010;750ml;1;;"<p>&lsquo;<em>Thrilling return to form for iconic Bordeaux blend Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) and equal Merlot, Cabernet Franc. 2010 red and black fruit, incense on the nose, plenty of reined-in power on the palate.

Promises to give much pleasure in the future.&rsquo;</em> &ndash; Platter&rsquo;s SA Wine Guide, 4.5* (2014)</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;A direct beam of blackberry and black currant fruit is intertwined with savory, sanguine and lightly singed cedar notes. Shows good focus through the finish, where a perfumy rooibos tea accent lingers. Sneakily long and should unfold more in the cellar.

Paul Sauer;2011;750ml;1;;"<p><i>&lsquo;Always close to the top of the red Bordeaux style pile in South Africa, Paul Sauer is one of a </i><i>handful of wines that is collectible, partly because of its track record, but also because it ages so well. This blend of Cabernet with 18% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot is aged entirely in new oak, but you&rsquo;d never know it, such is its grace and poise. Subtle, leafy, spicy and very fine. Drink: 2015-30.&rsquo;</i>- Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 95/100</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;Sense of place in this iconic flagship; richly vinous more than fruity, with supple muscularity. 2011 touch more aromatic in youth, with hint oak (new French); but firm underbelly, austere conclusion from its 70% Cabernet Sauvignon portends well for future.

Paul Sauer;2012;750ml;1;;"<p><i>'This brilliant Bordeaux blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% each of Merlot and Cabernet </i><i>Franc is always sourced from the same 40-year-old block on the farm.

<p><em>'Cabernet-based flagship, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot. 2012 with usual richly vinous, muscular build; penetrating ripe fruit to balance concluding austerity. Beautifully composed, complemented by new oak, a long, fine future assured.</em> '- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 4.5*</p>"

Paul Sauer;2014;750ml;1;;"<p><i>&lsquo;Paul Sauer is one of the few genuine Cape icons. Blending mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it always seems to absorb its 24 months in new oak with ease. More forward than the straight Kanonkop Cabernet but just as age worthy, this is savoury and focused with leafy freshness. Drink 2019-30.&rsquo;</i> - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2017, 96/100</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;Regarded as a SA &lsquo;first growth&rsquo; Bordeaux blend, traditionally Cabernet-based with Merlot, Cabernet Franc, as in 2014 with 74/17/9 composition.

Paul Sauer;2015;750ml;1;;"<p><em>A great wine, with a distinguished track record in one of the best-ever Cape vintages: if any South African wine deserves 100 points, and I strongly believe that it does, then it is the brilliant 2015 Paul Sauer, one of the greatest young wines I have ever tasted.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp; Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2018, 100/100</p>
<p><em>'Rightly regarded as SA &lsquo;first growth&rsquo; Bordeaux blend, traditionally Cabernet-based with Merlot, Cabernet Franc; 70/15/15 in 2015 which, though less plush than 2014 in cooler summer, exudes a controlled opulence thanks to satisfying dry finish and firm tannic foundation for extended ageing.'</em> - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2019, 5* (95/100)</p>"
Paul Sauer;2016;750ml;1;;"Stately and ageworthy Bordeaux blend.
