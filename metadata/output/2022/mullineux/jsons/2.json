  "description": "*'Made from vintages 2008-2014, fractionally blended solera-style (hence the \u2018pig Latin\u2019 name!). NV richly woven, with layered glac\u00e9 pineapple, caramel, citrus peel and toasted hazelnuts; vast 260 g/l sugar is uncloying, with lovely freshness, piquancy and length at just 11% alcohol. A Bacchanalian masterpiece, deserved recipient of the inaugural Dessert Wine of the Year award.'* - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 5\u2606\n\n *\u2018The Non-Vintage Olerasay is a solera made from oxidized Mullineux Straw Wine between 2008 and 2014 - two barrels held back to top up each year and it will only be released in years when it is felt to be superior to the straw wine. It delivers 268 grams per liter of residual sugar. It has a captivating nose with Barsac-like barley sugar, honey and marmalade with very little signs of oxidation. The palate is smooth and utterly harmonious, extraordinarily pure with perfect acidity, and sensual with honey, mandarin, peach and a touch of brown sugar on the long finish. It is the harmony here that grabs you - almost effortless. Stunning. It is not the most unctuous wine, the most powerful and ostentatious, yet that precision in the finish is bewitching and worthy of what I think to date might the highest score I have ever awarded to a South African wine.'* \u2013 Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 99/100 (Apr 2017 )\n\n *'A solera straw wine, made from seven different vintages and three vineyards, this is one\nof the Cape\u2019s greatest ever sweet wines. Boasting 260 grams of sugar, it\u2019s rich and exotic, \nshowing flavours of pineapple, apricot and coconut, as well as burnt toffee and tarte tatin. A\ndessert in a glass.'* - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 96/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Mullineux vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2039) or withdrawal.",
