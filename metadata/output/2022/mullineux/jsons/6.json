  "description": "'It is an ethereal wine that gives me no choice but to use a simple word loaded with meaning and one I rarely use with respect to wine...perfection. The 375ml bottle was examined over the course of two weeks during which time it barely changed. Each time I put it under a microscope looking for a fault. I never found one. Golden in colour, it has an intoxicating bouquet with orange sorbet, quince, lemon verbena and a very slight Asz\u00fa-like note that hovers in the background. Having recently tasted plenty of Sauternes, I can\u2019t help noticing how the aromatics are unencumbered by a thick cloak of oak, thereby lending the bouquet brightness and vividness that is totally enthralling. This all translates across to the crystalline palate. The perfect seam of acidity cuts like an ancient Samurai sword through the viscous fruit whose purity is off the charts. This electrifying Olerasay does not mess about \u2013 it immediately thrills the senses with its m\u00e9lange of blood orange, apricot, crushed minerals and passion fruit. There is so much energy in this wine. The finish has a weightless quality that means, despite its high residual sugar level, the wine is actually easy to drink and is not weighed down by its own unctuousness. The killer aspect of this is the soup\u00e7on of bitter orange that hits the back of the throat. I suspected that a perfect Olerasay was possible after the first iteration. This is it. Despite this being a Cellar Favorite, don\u2019t feel you are committing a heinous crime popping the cork now because who knows where we will be by the end of 2020. Just bear in mind that this wine will last decades.' - Neal Martin, Vinous, 100/100 (Jul 2020)   'Remarkable occasionally released dessert wine, Chenin Blanc from 3 parcels with highest acidity, mat-dried to intensify aromas and flavours; fractionally blended for further concentration, complexity and harmony. NV from 2008-2019 vintages, wonderfully elegant and multi-layered, near-perfect balance of acid and sugar.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2021, 5* (97/100)  A total one-off in the world of South African wine, this is the second release from the Mullineux's Chenin Blanc solera, made with components that date back to 2008. It has a cavity-challenging 331 grams of sugar, but you don't notice the sweetness because of the balancing acidity. Almond, marzipan, apple tart, citrus peel and layers of balsamic complexity make this one of the best sweet wines in the Cape. 2020-28' - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020, 97/100",
