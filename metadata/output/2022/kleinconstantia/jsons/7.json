  "description": "'93 in squat 500ml bottle moulded on the legendary 18th Century shapes; deeper gold-tinted than some previous, it has the clear-flavoured, ripe sunshine intensity of delicate Muscat. But without botrytis. Constance might not overpower, but it has its own riveting, complex minty/eucalyptus, sweet lemon-honey impact, with an obvious but more restrained than usual Muscat topping. French tourists who know their history arrive at the cellar asking for 'Le Vin de Napoleon'. It's the most quickly sold out, severely allocated Klein Constantia label.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 1998, Superior Cape Wine The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
