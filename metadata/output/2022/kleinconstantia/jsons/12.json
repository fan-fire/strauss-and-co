  "description": "\u2018This dessert wine is loaded from the get-go, with mango, blood orange, smoke, persimmon, ginger, date and fig flavors, all on a burnished texture supported by well-imbedded acidity. Superlong finish. Gorgeous. Late harvest Muscat de Frontignan. 1,049 cases made.\u2019 \u2013 Wine Spectator 93/100 (2003)\n\u2018RS 160 g/l, pH 3.5, TA 9.5 g/l. Vanilla pod, mixed peel, spiced oranges, cloves, raisins, thick and gloopy but with a whistlingly fresh finish from the acidity that keeps magnificent balance. The orange character is really pure on the palate, like tangerine slices \u2013 tangy and freshly-peeled.\u2019 \u2013 Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com 17.5/20 (2009)",
