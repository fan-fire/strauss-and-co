  "description": "\u2018Confirming anew the international status its ancestor enjoyed two centuries back, and fortunately soon in greater quantities as new plantings of Muscat de Frontignan come into production. No botrytis, just healthy ripeness taken to a superb extreme, to give a silkily textured wine, with fine mineral acidity. Big, concentrated \u201898 has typically, tropical/apricot/raisin scents and flavours, with a marmalade twist.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2004, 4\u2606\u2018*This dessert wine is loaded from the get-go, with mango, blood orange, smoke, persimmon, ginger, date and fig flavors, all on a burnished texture supported by well-imbedded acidity. Superlong finish. Gorgeous. Late harvest Muscat de Frontignan. 1,049 cases made.*\u2019 \u2013 Wine Spectator 93/100 (2003)\n\n\n\u2018*RS 160 g/l, pH 3.5, TA 9.5 g/l. Vanilla pod, mixed peel, spiced oranges, cloves, raisins, thick and gloopy but with a whistlingly fresh finish from the acidity that keeps magnificent balance. The orange character is really pure on the palate, like tangerine slices \u2013 tangy and freshly-peeled.\u2019* *\u2013* Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com 17.5/20 (2009)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
