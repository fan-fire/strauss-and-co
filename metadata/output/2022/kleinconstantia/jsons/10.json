  "description": "\u2018This has the color of dark iced tea, with a burnished edge to the maple, clove, date, green tea and mulled spice notes all laced with tangy acidity and a long, incense-infused finish. Clearly maturing in its flavor profile, but still with plenty of zip.--Non-blind Vin de Constance vertical ... 1,036 cases made.\u2019 \u2013 Wine Spectator \u00a092/100 (2010)\n\u2018The 1996 Vin de Constance is has a lucid amber hue. The nose is very engaging: marmalade, seaweed, quince, frangipane and a touch of chlorine \u2013 more like a mature Barsac than mature Sauternes. The palate is medium-bodied with a restrained viscous entry of mandarin, orange rind and quince. It is nicely focused and precise, even if it does not quite possess the delineation of the 2007 and 2008 on the finish. Very fine.\u2019 \u2013 Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 94/100 (Oct 2013)",
