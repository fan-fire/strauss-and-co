  "description": "\u2018Continually reclaiming the international renown its ancestor enjoyed 2 centuries back; from usually unbotrytised but superbly ripe Muscat de Frontignan giving a long-lived, silkily textured wine with fine mineral acidity. Riveting old-gold-coloured '00 somewhat drier (141g/L), full, gorgeously complex panoply of a aromas/flavours (from muscatty grape to citrus, dried peach to marmalade), refined silky richness, balanced acidity. There some 2 years in used 500L French oak barrels, after ferment/time in tank. In specially made 500ml hand-blown-style-bottles.\u2019 \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2006, 5*\n\u2018Runny caramel on the nose, and a lovely amber hue in the glass. Roasted nuts, musk, very lengthy black-treacle finish and orange and quince fruit \u2013 the fruit is definitely past its first flush, though the wine is still very much alive.\u2019 \u2013 Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17/20 (2009)\n\u00a0",
