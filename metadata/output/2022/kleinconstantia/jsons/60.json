  "description": "\u2018Iconic recreation of legendary 18th-and 19-century Constantia sweet wine. From Muscat de Frontignan harvested as ripe berries (for acidity) and raisins (for sugar concentration), stellar 2017 delivers fragrant aromatic spices, honeyed floral highlights and piercing freshness, all in perfect balance and harmony after 36 months in oak (500L barrels and foudres) and acacia wood. 500 ml, also magnums.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2022, 5* (97/100)  \u2018\"Lighter and lighter\" is the motto at Klein Constantia these days, according to Matt Day. The latest, world-class release of Vin de Constance certainly doesn\u2019t lack sweetness at 165 grams or even concentration, but it has a freshness that's reminiscent of Vouvray or Barsac. Subtly wooded in 50% new barrels, it unfurls layers of citrus, toast and tarte tatin, with a drizzle of honey and vivid acidity and palate length. Bravo! 2022-35.\u2019 - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020 - Overall Sweet Wine of the Year, 98/100 \u2018Lustrous mid gold. Dried apricot, orange blossom and citrus peels on the nose, suffused with nutmeg, clove and coffee cream, and an earthy, spicy, saffron-like note. Richly sweet and unctuously textured, but with a streak of acidity that balances beautifully, and gives a preserved grapefruit and lemon flavour. Fantastic length.\u2019 - Tim Jackson MW, JancisRobinson.com, 18/20 (Nov 2021)",
