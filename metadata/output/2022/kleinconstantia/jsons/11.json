  "description": "\u2018Candied orange peel, cherries, and spices are intermingled with hints of honey in its gorgeously defined aromatics. This wine, produced entirely from Muscat, is lively, elegant, packed with nuanced flavours, and sports a long, supple, expressive finish.\u2019\u00a0 Pierre Rovani, Wine Advocate, 93/100 (Feb 2003)",
