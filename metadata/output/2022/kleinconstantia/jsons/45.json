  "description": "*\u2018Iconic, oak-aged and age worthy dessert from unbotrytised Muscat de Frontignan. Drop-dead gorgeous 2012, exotic tropical fruit, marzipan and fynbos notes, silky sweetness. Racy acidity, energising freshness enhanced by tight-grained acacia oak joining the usual mix of new/used French/Hungarian oak.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2017, 5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018The 2012 Vin de Constance won\u2019t be released for another year, but put a note in your diary to buy some when it is. Sweeter and more alcoholic than the 2011, but somehow fresher and brighter, too, it\u2019s floral, pure and focused, with notes of orange zest, tarte tatin and well integrated oak. Shaping up to be the best Vin de Constance yet. Drink: 2016-25. Overall Sweet Wine of the Year.\u2019* - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2015, 97/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
