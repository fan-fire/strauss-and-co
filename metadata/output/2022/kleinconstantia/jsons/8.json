  "description": "Constance might not overpower, but it has its own riveting, complex minty, sweet lemon-honey impact, with an obvious but more restrained than usual Muscat flair. Latest '94 propels the style, burnished gold, delicate lime nuances, enticing nut flavours, neat sweet tang.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 1999, 5\u2606 **\u2018***A vintage with immense power and concentration, and still in quite a burly and youthful stage, almost bold and brooding. Big and luscious, but with superb definition. One for the long haul\u2019* \u2013 Higgo Jacobs 2016, 95/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
