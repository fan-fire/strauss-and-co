  "description": "*\u2018Iconic reprise of legendary 18th-century Constantia sweet wine, eagerly awaited 2015 is spectacular. Muscat de Frontignan, harvested through the season as ripe berries (for acidity) and raisins (for sugar concentration), delivers fragrant aromatic spices, honeyed floral highlights and piercing freshness, all in perfect balance and harmony after 42 months in 500L barrels. 500 ml and magnum.\u2019* - \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2020, 5\u2606 (95/100) \n\n *Even better than the 2014 release - and that was a spectacular sweet wine - the 2015 Vin de Constance is one of the greatest ever vintages of this iconic sticky. More Barsac than Sauternes in terms of weight, it\u2019s fresh and refined, a bit like the 2012, with citrus and orange zest balancing the 172 grams of sugar. The oak is perfectly judged, the length and freshness things of wonder. 2019-30.'* - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2018, Overall Sweet WIne of the Year, 98/100 \n\n*'An historical wine, Vin de Constance has been re-established in the last few years as one of the world\u2019s finest sweet wines. Dried Muscat grapes are aged for three years before bottling, in French and Hungarian casks with a touch of acacia wood. Citrus, orange zest, rosewater and spice notes leap out of the glass. The palate has a laser-like focus with massive sweetness perfectly balanced by acidity and a mineral finish. As impressive as Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem (and considerably better value). Drinking window 2020 - 2030.'* - Andy Howard MW, Decanter, 98/100 (2019)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
