  "description": "\u2018Confirming anew the international status its ancestor enjoyed 2 centuries back, and fortunately soon in greater quantities as new plantings of Muscat de Frontignan come into production. Frequent 5* over the years. Usually no botrytis, just healthy ripeness taken to a superb extreme, to give a silkily textured wine, with fine mineral acidity. Raisiny luxuriance of '99 also evokes dried apricot, marmalade, shot through with thrilling acid; fine lingering farewell. 14.5%; 183g/L sugar.\u2019\u00a0\u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2005, 4.5*\nVanilla pod, mixed peel, spiced oranges, cloves, raisins, thick and gloopy but with a whistlingly fresh finish from the acidity that keeps magnificent balance. The orange character is really pure on the palate, like tangerine slices \u2013 tangy and freshly-peeled.\u2019\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com \u00a017.5/20 (2009)",
