  "description": "\u2018Reaching (in patented 500ml old-style bottles) for the international renown its ancestor enjoyed two centuries back; from usually unbotrytised but ripe Muscat de Frontignan, generally giving a long-lived, silky wine with fine mineral acidity. \u201801 is more obviously Muscat, with floral/grapey/raisiny character; full-flavoured and sumptuous - gentler acid means effectively sweeter balance than many previous, involving 135g/l sugar, big 14.8% alcohol. Should acquire more complexity with time. These up to 4 years in used 500l French oak barrels.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5\u2606*\u2018Sweet and rich, but also super racy, with fresh-cut tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors, backed by bright acidity and a long, lingering finish of spice, orange zest and heather honey. Hard to resist now, but should age wonderfully. Muscat de Frontignan.\u2019* - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (2007)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
