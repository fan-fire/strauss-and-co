  "description": "\u2018Sweet and rich, but also superracy, with fresh-cut tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors, backed by bright acidity and a long, lingering finish of spice, orange zest and heather honey. Hard to resist now, but should age wonderfully. Muscat de Frontignan.\u2019 - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (2007)",
