  "description": "Bottled decadence, 2007 is the latest iconic dessert wine from unbotrytised Muscat de Frontignan. New oak (65%) melts into unctuous glac\u00e9 pineapple and barley sugar flavours. Rich and complex, but lacks the vibrant freshness of exceptional 2006 (5 stars).' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2013, 4.5\u2606 \u2018*It has an explosive bouquet that sprints out of the blocks with a more effervescent, vivacious personality than the 2008. Citrus lemon, Seville orange marmalade, touches of mandarin and a dash of spice all vie for attention \u2026 This is probably the finest Vin de Constance to date as it fans out marvellously on the multi-layered finish. This is a startling, world-class wine that gives Yquem a run for its money.*\u2019 Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 97/100 (2011)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
