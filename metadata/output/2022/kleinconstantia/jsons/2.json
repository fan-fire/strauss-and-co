  "description": "***\u2018****Brooding, dark, smoky notes. This is evolved, but stable. Much drier than the 1987, the \u201988 is better suited as an aperitif than dessert wine. A firm acid backbone and saline centre holds intact. Good condition.*\u2019 \u2013 Higgo Jacobs 2020, 92/100\n\n\n\u2018*Hugely complex on nose with Muscat fragrance, spice, white mushroom and some nuttiness, while the palate showed great focus and freshness. In terms of flavour, an almost peppery intensity before a long, saline finish.*\u2019 \u2013 Christian Eedes, Winemag.co.za 18/20 (2011)\n\n\n\u2018*The 1988 Vin de Constance has a deep nutty color. The nose is fully mature but beautifully defined with lifted Muscat notes augmented by hazelnut, marmalade and a touch of mint. The palate is medium-bodied with a bright, citric entry with hints of rosewater, quince, orange zest and dried apricot. It is very focused and full of tension on the finish although to be honest, I cannot envisage it improving further and I would gladly drink any bottles I had sooner rather than later.\u2019*\u00a0*\u2013*Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 88/100 (2013)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
