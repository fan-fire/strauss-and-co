  "description": "\u2018*Clear, layered mahogany / bronze with a green rim. Raisins with dried apricots and citrus peel on appealing, mellow, nose, focussed by a little VA. Luscious, sweet entry with good minerally acid core; vivid, apparently youthful flavours, long racy finish.*\u2019 \u2013 Angela Lloyd 2002, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
