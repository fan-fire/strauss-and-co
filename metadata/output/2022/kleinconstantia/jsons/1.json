  "description": "*'The first commercially sold vintage of the modern era is superb and rigid. Raisined fruit softness, with salted caramels and coffee. The creamy palate is laced with incredible lasting acidity, culminating in a savoury tail \u2013 like a sweet Oloroso*.\u2019 \u2013 Higgo Jacobs 2020, 96/100\n\n\n*\u20181986, limited bottling of unfortified replica of fabled 18th century dessert Constantias of Hendrick Cloete. Made every year at Klein Constantia since 1986 from Muscat de Frontignan \u2013 same clone selection as originally imported from western France by Governor Jan van Riebeeck in 1656. 1987 deeper coloured than 1986, more alcoholic at 15% cf. 14%, more mellifluous, more amply endowed with range of apricot-honey scents. Small barrel-aged, in newer oak than in historic bottlings. In Cloete\u2019s day, stems of bunches twisted when ripe and left to hang on vine, sugar and flavour concentration intensified by evaporation, leading to natural alcohols of up to 17%. Gower gets same result by halving the crop.* \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide (1992)\n\n\n*\u2018Wonderfully balanced, with limey freshness, nutty complexity and dabs of tropical fruit. A true legend that is still very much alive today.\u2019* \u2013 Roland Peens, 96 points (2018)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
