Riveting old-gold-coloured '00 somewhat drier (141g/L), full, gorgeously complex panoply of a aromas/flavours (from muscatty grape to citrus, dried peach to marmalade), refined silky richness, balanced acidity. There some 2 years in used 500L French oak barrels, after ferment/time in tank. In specially made 500ml hand-blown-style-bottles.**\u2019* \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2006, 5\u2606\n\n\n\u2018*Runny caramel on the nose, and a lovely amber hue in the glass. Roasted nuts, musk, very lengthy black-treacle finish and orange and quince fruit \u2013 the fruit is definitely past its first flush, though the wine is still very much alive.\u2019* *\u2013* Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17/20 (2009)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal.
