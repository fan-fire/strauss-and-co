  "description": "*\u2018Luscious unfortified dessert with international reputation spanning 2 centuries, typically from un-botrytised yet lusciously ripe Muscat de Frontignan. The 2002 is more slender than previous (13% alc vs 14.8%) but follows generous sun-blessed style, with tightrope balance. Marmalade, Asian spice hints, unctuous but uncloying.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2008, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018Marmalade, some green hints, menthol, pineapple cubes, a haunting floral bouquet. Nutty flavours emerging, with lavender, peach, honeycomb, lengthy and superbly even-handed mix of body, acidity and flavour.\u2019* - Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17.5/20 (Feb 2009)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
