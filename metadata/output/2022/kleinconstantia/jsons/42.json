  "description": "\u2018Consistently one of the best sweet wines in the world, this tea-leafy, honeyed, orange peel-scented Muscat is rich and sweet, with 152 grams of sugar, some skin tannins, nutmeg and ginger spice and a weighty, dense texture. Long, complex and assured. Drink: 2015-25.\u2019 \u2013 Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 96/100\n\u2018The nose is pretty and entirely captivating \u2013 citrus, lilac, herbs, spice, even a little mint. The palate, meanwhile, shows pure fruit and zippy acidity \u2013 it\u2019s an extraordinarily vivid glass of wine \u2013 the finish suitably long without being astringent. Really classy.\u2019- Christian Eedes, Winemag.co.za, 96/100 (2015)\n\u2018Iconic, ageworthy dessert from unbotrytised Muscat de Frontignan aged in French and Hungarian oak (some new). 2011 generous and satisfying with silky texture, sweetness lifted by racy acidity. 3 years oaked vs 4 for also-tasted 2009, with similar candied orange, fynbos fragrance, vanilla fudge and glazed pineapple flavours. No 2010. \u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2016, 5* ",
