  "description": "*'Iconic dessert wine from unbotrytised Muscat de Frontignan, No 2003; '04 charming peach and spicy-nutty cream. Less intense than some years, but still luscious and dense. 130 g/l RS, 14.2% alc in full, rich finish.'* - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2009, 4.5\u2606\n\n *'Lime and lemon cordial; floral, golden syrup. Acidity is bright and refreshing, and cuts the viscosity with razor-sharp precision. Treacle and caramelised fruits on the palate. There is a metallic tingle on the finish. Good, but not as finely balanced as other vintages by comparison.'* - Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 16.5/20 (Feb 2009)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
