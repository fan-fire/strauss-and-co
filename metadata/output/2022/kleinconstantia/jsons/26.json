  "description": "\u2018Pure orange peel, tangerine, persimmon and clementine flavors are laced with hints of green tea, candied lime peel and honeysuckle. Rich, but racy and mouthwatering. The gorgeous amber color and a caressing mouthfeel just add to the pleasure. Lovely precision. Should age nicely. Drink now through 2023.\u2019 - James Molesworth, Winespectator.com, 94/100 (2010)\n\u2018Iconic dessert from unbotrytised Muscat de Frontignan. '05 sleek, gleaming acidity in different, finer balance to previous (160 g/l RS; 12.2% alc). Lovely floral depth, precise long-lingering finish. These reward 5-10+ years in cellar with more complexity. \u00b1 3 years in combo steel, oak.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2009, 4.5*",
