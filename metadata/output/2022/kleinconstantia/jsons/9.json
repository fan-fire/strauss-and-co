  "description": "Rich, deep gold with characteristic mint-toffee-lime aromas, true to the style. A bold 14-15% alcohol structure ensures keepability; promises a long, operatic unfurling of layered nuances in bottle.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2000, 5\u2606 *'A definite dark rusty amber now, and showing much more oxidative aromas. Minty, orange peel, very complex flavours, and finely layered like puff pastry. Rasping acidity that keeps the thick marmalade unctuousness under control'.* **\u2013 Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17.5/20 (Feb 2009)**\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
