Estate\u2019s 4th re-enactment of Cape\u2019s most glorious wine times, two centuries ago. In traditional squat black 500ml bottle. From Muscat de Frontignan.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1994, 4\u2606\u2018*Offers a lovely amber color, with blood orange, bitter almond, clove, green tea and dried persimmon notes backed by a noticeably spicy Muscat hint on the finish. More rustic and broader than the other vintages, and not quite as deep or long.--Non-blind Vin de Constance vertical. Drink now through 2017. 2,425 cases made.*\u2019 \u2013 Wine Spectator (Tasted 2010), 90/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal.
