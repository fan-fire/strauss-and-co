  "description": "\u2018Nuts, Christmas spices, oranges and starfruit \u2013 delicious citric spritz. Caramel, cream, lemon, lime, orange, preserved tropical fruits. Still very powerful and focused, with a persistent length and a really quite youthful sort of concentration as well as plenty of secondary character.\u2019 - Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17.5+/20 (2009)\n\u2018Brilliant gold, amber tinge at centre. Fresh mint, raisins, lime marmalade scents. Similarly vibrant apricot, citrus concentration; mouthcoating richness; excellent sugar / acid balance.\u2019 \u2013 Angela Lloyd 2002, 4.5 Stars\n'A lighter and more subtle vintage, with lower intensity and sweetness. Elegant and drier expression of Vin de Constance.\u2019 \u2013 Higgo Jacobs 2016, 92/100",
