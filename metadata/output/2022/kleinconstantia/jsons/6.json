  "description": "*\u2018Nuts, Christmas spices, oranges and starfruit \u2013 delicious citric spritz. Caramel, cream, lemon, lime, orange, preserved tropical fruits. Still very powerful and focused, with a persistent length and a really quite youthful sort of concentration as well as plenty of secondary character.\u2019* - Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17.5+/20 (2009)\n\n\n\u2018*Brilliant gold, amber tinge at centre. Fresh mint, raisins, lime marmalade scents. Similarly vibrant apricot, citrus concentration; mouthcoating richness; excellent sugar / acid balance*.\u2019 \u2013 Angela Lloyd 2002, 4.5 Stars\n\n\n*'A lighter and more subtle vintage, with lower intensity and sweetness. Elegant and drier expression of Vin de Constance*.\u2019 \u2013 Higgo Jacobs 2016, 92/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
