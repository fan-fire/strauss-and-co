  "description": "\u2018Mellifluous and amply endowed with apricot-honey scents. Limited bottling of unfortified replica of fabled 18th century dessert Constantias of Hendrik Cloete. \u201886 from Muscat de Frontignan - same clone selection as originally imported from western France by Governor Jan van Riebeeck in 1656.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1992/1994 *\u2018Intense, lifted, fresh honey and lemon bouquet. Racy, minerally acid lends vivid clarity to the rich fruit, silky texture. Excellent balance. Incisively clean, long. Amazingly youthful.\u2019* Angela Lloyd  \n  \n*\u2018Startling caramelised orange nose, smoky, a touch of rancio, vivid. Medium bodied, moderate concentration, good acidity, a trace of oxidation, yet vibrant, with some tropical fruit. Peppery finish, fine length.\u2019* Stephen Brook, Decanter magazine.\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Klein Constantia\u2019s vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2031) or withdrawal. Vin de Constance is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 40 consecutive vintages.",
