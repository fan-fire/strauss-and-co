‘1986, limited bottling of unfortified replica of fabled 18th century dessert Constantias of Hendrick Cloete. Made every year at Klein Constantia since 1986 from Muscat de Frontignan – same clone selection as originally imported from western France by Governor Jan van Riebeeck in 1656. 1987 deeper coloured than 1986, more alcoholic at 15% cf. 14%, more mellifluous, more amply endowed with range of apricot-honey scents. Small barrel-aged, in newer oak than in historic bottlings. In Cloete’s day, stems of bunches twisted when ripe and left to hang on vine, sugar and flavour concentration intensified by evaporation, leading to natural alcohols of up to 17%. Gower gets same result by halving the crop. – Platter’s SA Wine Guide (1992)

Fantastic length.’ - Tim Jackson MW, JancisRobinson.com, 18/20 (Nov 2021)",0,,"‘Iconic recreation of legendary 18th-and 19-century Constantia sweet wine. From Muscat de Frontignan harvested as ripe berries (for acidity) and raisins (for sugar concentration), stellar 2017 delivers fragrant aromatic spices, honeyed floral highlights and piercing freshness, all in perfect balance and harmony after 36 months in oak (500L barrels and foudres) and acacia wood. 500 ml, also magnums.’ - Platter’s SA Wine Guide 2022, 5* (97/100)  ‘""Lighter and lighter"" is the motto at Klein Constantia these days, according to Matt Day. The latest, world-class release of Vin de Constance certainly doesn’t lack sweetness at 165 grams or even concentration, but it has a freshness that's reminiscent of Vouvray or Barsac. Subtly wooded in 50% new barrels, it unfurls layers of citrus, toast and tarte tatin, with a drizzle of honey and vivid acidity and palate length. Bravo! 2022-35.’ - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020 - Overall Sweet Wine of the Year, 98/100 ‘Lustrous mid gold.
