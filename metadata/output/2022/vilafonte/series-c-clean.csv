It is already showing great lift and freshness on the nose with more red fruit character than the 2007, doubtless due to the higher percentage of Merlot. There is also a floral component that is not evident in earlier vintages. The palate is very well balanced with lush ripe red-berried fruit that is beautifully integrated with the oak, with caressing tannins on the velvety dark plum and creme de cassis infused finish.

'The 2011 Series C was apparently the shortest vintage in history with warm days and cool nights. It is a blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% merlot, 14% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc, aged for 22 months in new and used barrels. There is a tangible “coolness” on the nose: not as intense of as exuberant as the previous two vintages, but replete with fine blackberry, autumn leave and mineral scents, suggesting a higher percentage of Cabernet than there actually is. The palate is medium-bodied with a supple entry. This is rounded and smooth with greater depth that the nose suggests. Here the Merlot plays a more conspicuous role than on the nose, fleshing and rounding out the finish that is harmonious and long. Very fine.' – Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 92/100 (2014)",farms/vilafonte/series-c/input/bottels/1s/Vilafonte_Series_C_2011 6846 - 644324.jpg,farms/vilafonte/series-c/output/assets/52.jpg

A deep ruby-purple colour, this really is an impressively intense and striking blend that is seductive and alluring from the moment the cork is pulled. The aromatics offer glimpses of black cherries, earthy stewed black plums, black currants, fertile loam, tilled earth, freshly cut hedgerow together with hints of hoisin plum sauce and melted chocolate nuances. The palate is medium to full bodied but incredibly pure and polished with a confident, approachable accessibility, sleek rounded tannins and layer upon layer of seamless creamy black berry fruits, saline liquorice, sweet cedar spice and a subtle blueberry accent on the vibrant fresh finish. This wine does not try and hide its sweet seductive black fruits yet there is certainly a subtle subtext of earthy, stony minerality that runs in unison with all the vivid fruit concentration.
