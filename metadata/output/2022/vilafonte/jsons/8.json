  "description": "\u2018Clearly Cabernet led (52%), which the name implies: more austere, imposing than the Series M, though influential 35% Merlot adds sweet-fruited mid-palate flesh. \u201804 has a serious tannin grip but also verve and freshness to balance the riper style, ensuring ageing potential. Seasoned with Cabernet Franc and Malbec (9/4%). Seamlessly polished by 19 months in\u00a0 \u00b170% new barriques. IWC gold.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5*\n\u2018Series C is the Cabernet-dominated version of a wine that brings together the winemaking talents of California winemaker Zelma Long and her viticulturist husband Phil Freese, along with Warwick Estate's Mike Ratcliffe and San Francisco-based importer Bartholemew Broadbent. Coffee, chocolate and dark berry fruits dominate this brooding wine that shows intensity and power. Yet it never becomes heavy or overripe\u2014here there is a good sense of balance that lifts the wine, especially in the aftertaste.\u2019 - Roger Voss, Wine Enthusiast, 94/100 (Nov 2006)",
