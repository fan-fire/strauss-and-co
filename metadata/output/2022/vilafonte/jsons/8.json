  "description": "Series C 2004 - refined' - Zelma Long *\u2018Clearly Cabernet led (52%), which the name implies: more austere, imposing than the Series M, though influential 35% Merlot adds sweet-fruited mid-palate flesh. \u201804 has a serious tannin grip but also verve and freshness to balance the riper style, ensuring ageing potential. Seasoned with Cabernet Franc and Malbec (9/4%). Seamlessly polished by 19 months in\u00a0 \u00b170% new barriques. IWC gold.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018Series C is the Cabernet-dominated version of a wine that brings together the winemaking talents of California winemaker Zelma Long and her viticulturist husband Phil Freese, along with Warwick Estate's Mike Ratcliffe and San Francisco-based importer Bartholemew Broadbent. Coffee, chocolate and dark berry fruits dominate this brooding wine that shows intensity and power. Yet it never becomes heavy or overripe\u2014here there is a good sense of balance that lifts the wine, especially in the aftertaste.\u2019* - Roger Voss, Wine Enthusiast, 94/100 (Nov 2006)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
