  "description": "\u2018A fairly big (14.5% alcohol), chewy wine, but one that delivers waves of lush fruit. Plum and cassis notes are framed by hints of smoke and cedar; the merest hint of green herbs adds complexity without detracting. Long and supple on the finish.\u2019 - Wine Enthusiast, 92/100 (Nov 2005)\n'The \u2018C\u2019 is for Cabernet Sauvignon, whose structure and power inform the masterly Bordeaux blend. It\u2019s dark-berried opulence is still swaddled in youthfully dense and austere tannins. One for the patient - should evolve into something majestic. 82% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. 54% new French oak for 18 months.'- Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2006, 4.5*",
