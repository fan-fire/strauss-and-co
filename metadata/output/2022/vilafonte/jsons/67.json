  "description": "\u2018Sumptuous quartet of Bordeaux varieties led by Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), 2014 gets more new oak (70%, 22 months) than sibling yet retains fruit purity and poise; shows superb tannic grip, perfumed cedarwood persistence which will see it through the next decade or more. 1.5 & 3L bottled for future release.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2018, 4.5* (92/100)\u00a0 \u2018Cabernet rules the blend here - hence C - with support from Merlot, Malbec and a splash of Cabernet Franc. This is a dense, serious, stylish, age worthy cuv\u00e9e that deserves its cult following. Structured, spicy and winningly oaked, with a core of refreshing black fruit. 2019-26.\u2019 - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2017, 96/100\u00a0 \u2018The 2014 Series C is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 6% Cabernet Franc, matured in 70% new French oak for 22 months. Deep in color, in my opinion it has a superior bouquet compared to the Series M this vintage: very well defined with gorgeous black cherry and blueberry fruit, the oak seamlessly integrated even though it will need 3-4 years to fully integrate. The palate is medium-bodied, smooth and velvety in texture with finely tuned acidity, nicely poised and gently fanning out with a fresh blackberry and bilberry finish, white pepper and clove lingering on the aftertaste. This is one of the most refined vintages of Series C that I have tasted.\u2019 - Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Apr 2017)",
