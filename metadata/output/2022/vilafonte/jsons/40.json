  "description": "Series C 2009 - rich and powerful' - Zelma Long *\u201c...dark chocolate and vanilla, demonstrating great precision on the finish with a hint of cappuccino on the aftertaste. This is superb. I have a lot of respect for the superlative Vilafont\u00e9 wines, where Zelma Long is at the helm, and their pair of 2009s do not disappoint. \" -* Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Sept 2012)\n\n\n*\u2018Standout, succulent Bordeaux blend, with amply oaked super-ripe fruit a hallmark, always Cabernet-dominated. 2009 (54% plus Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Malbec) rich, textured and spicy, the Cabernet Franc adding lift.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2012, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018This stunning wine is still quite young and shut-down on the nose, taking its time in the glass to truly begin to open up. Once it does, scents of licorice root, chicory, cassis and black plum fill the bouquet. The mouthfeel is bold and powerful, with gripping tannins that coat the palate and support the dense black-fruit core. Accents of black-tea leaves and sweet spice grace the long finish.\u2019* - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 93/100 (Jan 2013)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
