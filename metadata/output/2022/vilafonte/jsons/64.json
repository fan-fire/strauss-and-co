Richly styled with blackcurrant, graphite and cedar spice, polished tannin structure. Balanced, approachable (but best decanted); preferable to cellar 10 years.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2017, 4.5\u2606\n\n *\u2018Just nosing ahead of its stable mate, Series M, in 2013, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based cuv\u00e9e with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec is the best release yet from this South African/American collaboration. Dense, serious and yet beautifully refined, it\u2019s a balanced, refreshing, herbal, plum and incense-like red. One to cellar. Drink: 2017-25.'* - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2016, 95/100\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal.
