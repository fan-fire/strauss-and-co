  "description": "Series C 2007 - massive and potent' - Zelma Long *'Rich and lush, but very driven, with gorgeous fig bread, linzer torte, bittersweet ganache and mulled currant fruit flavors, all backed by hints of black tea, graphite and spice. The long finish lets everything hang together nicely. Impressive. The best vintage yet for this quietly and steadily improving project. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.'* -\u00a0 James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 93/100 (Nov 2010)\n\n\n*\u2018Polished, authoritative 2007 Bordeaux blend exhibits Merlot succulence and delightful herbal Cabernet Franc aromatics. Savoury Cabernet Sauvignon (74%) tannins provide a structured platform for abundant layers of dense black fruit, with a tight mineral centre. Includes splash of Malbec. 25 months in 94% new French oak.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2011, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018A beautifully balanced and nuanced wine. The aromas are heady and thick but still vibrant, displaying juicy notes of black cherry, black raspberry sauce and semi-dried fig laced with accents of bittersweet chocolate, tobacco and white pepper. The texture is like crushed satin, with well-integrated tannins and a creamy mouthfeel. Touches of licorice root and smoky cedar spice augment the dark fruit on the lengthy finish.\u2019* - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 93/100 (Mar 2011)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
