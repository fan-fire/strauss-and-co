  "description": "*'Series C 2016 - sensuous and refined'* - Zelma Long\n\n *\u2018Refined, ageworthy Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend with Merlot, Malbec, and Cabernet Franc (15/12/11), 2016 less dense, more elegant than previous. Black-fruit intensity and length, also dark chocolate and pencil shavings from 22 months in 77% new French oak.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2020, 4.5\u2606 (93/100)\n\n*\u2018Series C seemed to cope a little better with the heat of the 2016 vintage than its stablemate Series M, partly because it's Cabernet Sauvignon based with 15% Merlot and only 12% of less stable Malbec. With flavours of liquorice, plum and blackberry, this is a layered, well-structured red with impressive concentration, fine oak and granular tannins. 2021-28.\u2019* - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2019, 96/100 \n\n*\u2018A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec, the 2016 Series C has sweet oak on the nose with spiced blackberry and blueberry compote. The wine is expressive with generous dark fruits, bitter chocolate and Christmas spice. Full-bodied, it has a broad-shouldered, rich and juicy finish. This is very Napa-esque with its juiciness and high complexity. Well done! It is delicious.\u2019* - Anthony Mueller, Wine Advocate, 94+/100 (Oct 2019)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
