  "description": "\u2018A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Malbec, 19% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, spicy aromas of leather, black pepper, savory herbs, licorice and Mexican chocolate lead the nose. It's grounded by a solid fruit core of blackberry, boysenberry and mulberry fruit, lending a supporting spine to the toasted spice and earthy accents. Well balanced, with velvety tannins and a long, evolving finish, drink this lush, velvety red from 2018\u20132024.\u2019 - Lauren Buzzeo, Wine Enthusiast, 94/100 (Jan 2015)\n\u2018A four-way blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is another more restrained style from Vilafont\u00e9. Mint, fresh herbs, sweet plum and cassis fruit, textured tannins and a firm, rigorous finish that suggests the wine will age well. Drink: 2016-25.\u2019 - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2015, 94/100\n\u2018Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, as name hints, with Malbec and Merlot, and 7% Cabernet Franc in 2012 versus none in 2011. Classic aromas and flavours - blackcurrant, graphite and cedarwood spice. Balanced, for early drinking after decanting for an hour or 2; will also reward a decade+ cellaring.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2016, 4.5*",
