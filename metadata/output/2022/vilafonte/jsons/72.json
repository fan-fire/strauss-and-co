  "description": "Series C 2015 - nuanced and scintillating' - Zelma Long *\u2018Dense yet refined Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec (19/15/9), 2015 deserves lengthy cellaring, 22 months in French oak (67% new) adding to structure, poise and persistent cedarwood perfume.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2019, 4.5\u2606 (94/100)\n\n\n*\u2018C stands for Cabernet Sauvignon, which never represents less than half of the blend. The brilliant 2015 has 19% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec, but it\u2019s Cabernet Sauvignon that provides the backbone. Rich, structured and serious, with lots of cigar box perfume, fine-boned tannins and considerable potential. 2022-30.\u2019* - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2018, 96/100\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal.
