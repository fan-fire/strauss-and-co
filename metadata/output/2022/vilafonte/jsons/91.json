  "description": "*'Series C 2018 - Perfumed and intense'* - Zelma Long\n\n *\u2018Sold at more than twice the price of the Series M for reasons of demand alone, this is a suitably Californian style from Chris de Vries and West Coast co-owner Zelma Long. Combining Cabernet Sauvignon with 44% Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, it's at the glossy, ripe, polished end of the spectrum, with 70% new coffee bean oak and graphite on the nose, fig, orange peel and blackcurrant fruit, layered, enveloping tannins and a balanced finish. 2023- 28.\u2019* - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2021, 95/100\n\n *\u2018Beginning impeccably balanced and generous on the nose, the 2018 Series C is wrapped in elegant baking spices from the almost 70% new French oak. A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 14% Malbec and 11% Cabernet Franc, the wine bursts with finesse, precision, elegance and juicy dark fruit. Full-bodied, the Series C boasts juicy blackberry essence, notes of black raspberry cobbler, toasted pie crust and cedar cigar box in the mouth, with pure balance, fine-grained tannins, succulent acidity and a mineral tension across the mid-palate. It ends with a long, winding finish that evolves with persistence. This vintage marks another successful bottling. The only downside is that only 36 barrels were made. This is highly collectible stuff!\u2019* - Anthony Mueller, Wine Advocate, 94/100 (Feb 2021)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
