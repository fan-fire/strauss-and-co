  "description": "\u2018Harmonious 2006 Cabernet-led blend, with 40% Merlot and splash Cabernet Franc for aromatic lift. Compact, ripe polished blackcurrant and plum fruit currently masked by resolute but seamless tannins, long finish. 95% new Fr oak.\u2019\u00a0 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2009, 5*\n'This is concentrated and winey, but nicely integrated already, with briar, blackberry, mulled currant, black tea and dark cocoa notes all gliding through the sleek, fine-grained finish, where a perfumy hint lingers. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc'. - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (Jun 2010)",
