  "description": "\u2018Fully justifying owner Mike Ratcliffe's praise for the 2017 vintage, Series C is Cabernet Sauvignon based with 21% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. Aged in 70% new wood, it's serious, toasty and plush with smooth tannins, bramble, plum, cassis and black fig flavours, fresh acidity and very fine, ageworthy tannins. 2022-29.\u2019 - Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2020, 96/100\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2018The 2017 Series C is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec matured in 70% French oak for 22 months. It has an opulent, beautifully controlled yet sensual bouquet featuring layers of precise black cherry, blackberry, cedar and violet scents. The palate is medium-bodied with ripe, juicy tannins. A voluminous and extravagant Series C whose smooth, velvety, almost creamy finish manages to avoid cloying. Made in a California more than Bordeaux vein, with a 20-year lifespan.\u2019 - Neal Martin, Vinous, 94/100 (Apr 2021) \u00a0 \u2018The Series C 2017 displays an incredibly deep, dark broody garnet-purple colour with imposing extract and concentration. On the nose, this youthful release is a little closed to begin with but opens up in the glass offering alluring notes of incense, sweet vanilla pod, caramelised cashew nuts, black berry reduction, juniper berry and dusty, graphite tinged black chocolate exoticism. The palate is velvety and supple with a most generous, multi-layered mouthfeel of blueberry, black cherries, saline cassis and a charcoal tinged buttered brown toasty finish. Where the 2015 release showed a more masculine power, the 2017 is the personification of intensity with elegance, finesse and grace. A producer can wait decades to realise a vintage like this that possesses this degree of poise, intensity and weightless concentration combined with a decadently fruited complexity and composure. A spellbinding new release from Vilafont\u00e9. Indulge yourself by drinking a few bottles in its youth, however the 2017 is certainly worthy of over a decade or more of cellaring to realise its full potential.\u2019 - Greg Sherwood MW, Fine Wine Safari, 96+/100 (Oct 2019)",
