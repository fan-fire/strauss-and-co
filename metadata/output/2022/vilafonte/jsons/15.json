  "description": "\u201cMostly Cabernet Sauvignon, as name implies (66%, with 22% Merlot, 6% each Malbec and Cabernet Franc), in this powerful but seamless and polished red; \u201905 rich, scented, resolute but ripe tannins, harmonious oaking (90% new French)\u201d - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2008, 4.5*\n'Still tight, but with impressive concentration and precision to the layers of plum, red currant, roasted vanilla, espresso bean and mineral. Focused, almost sleek on the finish, with fine length. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. This young project from Mike Ratcliffe (Warwick Estate) and Zelma Long is getting better every year.' - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (Feb 2009)",
