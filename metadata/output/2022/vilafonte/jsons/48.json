  "description": "Series C 2011 - complex and layered' - Zelma Long *'Seductive Bordeaux blend, Cabernet-based as name hints, with Merlot and Malbec (26/14), drops 10\u2019s Cabernet Franc in and concentrated 11 (5\u2606). Classic claret markers and ripe cassis, graphite and spice (courtesy 80% new oak). Smoothly delicious now and more so given time.'* \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2015, 5\u2606\n\n\n*'Very dense, with a loamy hint backing the core of licorice snap, black currant paste and warm fig fruit. This shows ample grip but remains polished and integrated, while espresso and black tea accents fill out the finish. Impressive. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc... 541 cases made.* '\u2013 Wine Spectator \u00a093/100 (2014)\n\n\n*'The 2011 Series C was apparently the shortest vintage in history with warm days and cool nights. It is a blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% merlot, 14% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc, aged for 22 months in new and used barrels. There is a tangible \u201ccoolness\u201d on the nose: not as intense of as exuberant as the previous two vintages, but replete with fine blackberry, autumn leave and mineral scents, suggesting a higher percentage of Cabernet than there actually is. The palate is medium-bodied with a supple entry. This is rounded and smooth with greater depth that the nose suggests. Here the Merlot plays a more conspicuous role than on the nose, fleshing and rounding out the finish that is harmonious and long. Very fine*.' \u2013 Neal Martin, Wine Advocate 92/100 (2014)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2029) or withdrawal. An exclusive & exceptional dinner for 3 guests at acclaimed Stellenbosch restaurant Rykaarts hosted by Vilafont\u00e9 owner Michael S. Ratcliffe and/or Head Winemaker Chris de Vries. A selection of vintage Vilafont\u00e9 to be carefully paired with the evening.",
