  "description": "*\u2018Brambly forest-floor berries hemmed in by intense grassiness, stylish finish signals maturation potential, but needs a decade from harvest. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 2 years in 80% new French oak.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2003, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n*\u2018Muscular currant, cassis, iron and dark chocolate notes. Tannic, but lots of flesh, with a lingering tobacco note. Maybe a touch austere for some, but admirable concentration. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.\u2019* - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 89/100 (Apr 2003)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
