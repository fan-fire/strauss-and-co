  "description": "*'Mature, ripe, heady nose show some reduction. The palate is meaty with dried herbs and dark plums. Spicy with slight vanilla note, good poise and depth. Drink now to 2030.' -* Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100\n\n\n*'Parallel drawn with the 2005 Cabernet, displaying a similar nose of wood polish and mint. The palate is on another level though. Power and finesse. Incredible concentration of deep, dark fruits presented in a completely harmonious, seamless palate delivery. Expect a healthy sediment deposit. Decant for an hour and enjoy.'*- Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 94/100\n\n\n*'Among South Africa\u2019s original Bordeaux-style reds, still finely judged, elegant and classically styled. 05 cassis and graphite whiffs; plush yet lithe and restrained, with good grip from 69% Cabernet (with Merlot and Cabernet Franc), 14.4% alc well hidden. Ageworthy. 2 years oak, 75% new.'* - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2010, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
