  "description": "Seal Code: 4967 - 0383783\n\n'Mature, ripe, heady nose show some reduction. The palate is meaty with dried herbs and dark plums. Spicy with slight vanilla note, good poise and depth. Drink now to 2030.' - Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100\n'Parallel drawn with the 2005 Cabernet, displaying a similar nose of wood polish and mint. The palate is on another level though. Power and finesse. Incredible concentration of deep, dark fruits presented in a completely harmonious, seamless palate delivery. Expect a healthy sediment deposit. Decant for an hour and enjoy.'- Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 94/100\n'Among South Africa\u2019s original Bordeaux-style reds, still finely judged, elegant & classically styled. 05 cassis & graphite whiffs; plush yet lithe & restrained, with gd grip from 69% cab (with merlot, cab f), 14.4% alc well hidden. Ageworthy. 2 yrs oak, 75% new.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2010, 4.5*",
