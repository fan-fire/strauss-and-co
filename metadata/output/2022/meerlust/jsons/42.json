  "description": "*\u2018Longstanding benchmark Bordeaux-style red, eschews showiness for restraint. 2006 cassis and cherry notes; concentrated, not plush, powdery tannins, tealeaf whiffs. Oak (70% new) evident; less supple than 2005. From Cabernet Sauvignon, with 16% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Merlot.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2011, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
