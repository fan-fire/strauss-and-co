  "description": "Seal Code: 3930 - 738025\n\nOne of the all time greats from Meerlust, this was one of Giorgio dalla Cia\u2019s last great vintages which won the Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande Best Bordeaux Blend Trophy in 2006. Still beautifully vital and intensely coloured showing a crystalline ruby red hue. The nose is jam packed full of black cassis fruit, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed coffee beans, violets and sweet dried baking spices. Plush, lush and almost weightless in the mouth, the palate is so broad, concentrated, vibrant and intense, with the most harmonious youthful balance and seamless silky balance with just a hint of salinity and mineral graphite on the finish. So suave, so regal, this is a wine that defines elegance. A true South African icon. Drink now to 2040+. - Wine Safari Score: 96+/100 Greg Sherwood MW (2019)",
