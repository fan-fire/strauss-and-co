  "description": "*Cerise-brick edge. Spicy, with camphor, mushroomy, earthy whiffs, primary fruit all gone but leaving behind a lovely integration and a harmonious finish*.\u00a016.5/20 (750ml). - Michael Fridjhon, World of Fine Wine (2014)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
