  "description": "Seal Code: 7330 - 845266\n\n'Dark ripe, cola and ribena. Quite round, soft, juicy and attractive. Nice balance of savoury and primary fruit. Pretty long and impressive. Drink now to 2030' - Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100\n'Superlative 2010 follows sensational 2009 (4.5 stars, 92 pts), maintains classicism of this flagship cab-dominated (65%) Bordeaux blend. Plush, the dark fruit absorbs & integrates the oak influence (60% new, 21 months) within complex, dense structure. For the long haul. '- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 5*\n'A good example of a modernised Cape classic, Rubicon is great to drink at five years and will mature well thereafter. Subtle oak, graphite, autumn leaves, cassis and fine-boned tannins: this wine is remarkably complex and a brilliant follow-up to the 2009. Drink: 2015-25 '- Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 94/100",
