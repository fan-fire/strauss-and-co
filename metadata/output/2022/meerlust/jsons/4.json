  "description": "*\u2018In an increasingly crowded field of local excellence, this remains among the top South African claret blends; consistently elegant, medium-bodied, carefully oaked, restrained but perfumed, with some classic, minerally, claret undertones. A ripe vegetal/herbal nuance is often apparent, with dried tea leaf associations. A medium-length finish, in a routinely medium-strength wine. The '84, undoubtedly one of the best vintages, was, for well-known French shipper Paul Bouchard, \"the finest French claret outside France\". Meerlust Rubicons are not big, plummy over-oaked or over-done New World or Californian creations. The aim has been not so much to attack the nostrils, with an upfront bouquet of raw cedary oak, but to go for elegant complexity on the palate.\u2019*\u00a0 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1990, 5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
