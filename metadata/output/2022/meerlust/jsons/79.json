  "description": "\u2018Good restraint here, with classic cassis fruit and a dark liquorice and aniseed character on the palate. High but fine tannin. Enough fruit at its core to age well.\u2019 - Richard Hemming MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17/20 (Sept 2017)*\u2018Cabernet Sauvignon-based (67%) flagship blend with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. One of the most classic local expressions of the style. 2014 gentler than the Cabernet Sauvignon, with the sleek, darkly bright elegance of the Merlot, and its own firm tannic balance and succulent suppleness based on ripe fruit.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2018, 4.5\u2606\u00a0\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
