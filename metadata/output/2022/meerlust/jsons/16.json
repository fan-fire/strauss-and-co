  "description": "\u2018*For many \u2013 including followers abroad \u2013 this remains an ultimate name and statement in Cape claret style. Rubicon remains the quintessence of refined understatement \u2013 serious, medium-textured vinosity, ripe but not overripe berry flavours, moderate grip from tannins, essentially dry rather than fruity-sweet. Winemaker Dalla Cia considers Rubicon a \u201cbetter, richer, more complex wine than Cabernet Sauvignon on its own could ever be\u201d. Here, the blend is about 65-70% Cabernet, 20-25% Merlot, balance Cabernet Franc. New Nevers barrel-matured about 18 months to 2 years, through malo. Dalla Cia has never wavered stylistically: while others see-sawed between bold fruity \u201cNew World modernity\u201d and \u201cCape tradition\u201d this Bordeaux-style standard-bearer has kept a constant course, for nearly 2 decades, openly aiming at European restraint and vinosity. '94 splendid array of layered fruit, tannin, oak.\u2019*\u00a0\u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide (1999)\n\n\n*'The 1994 is traditional in style with a freshness that belies its age, red berry fruit and delicate complexity*.' Roland Peens 91 points 2019\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
