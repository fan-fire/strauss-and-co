  "description": "Seal Code: 6061 - 578847\n\n'As expected, the highlight of the tasting. Pure and beguiling nose, with Bordeaux-like graphite and forest floor notes. Dense, rich, and structured with powerful yet lacy tannins. Fine balance with a serious demeanour. Drink 2025 to 2040.'- Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 95/100\n'Expressive of the vintage, the 2009 shows more intensity and concentration of dark fruit, still very tightly packed. Hint of sweet mocha. Unwavering structure, although there is a sweetness and opulence to the fruit that allows drinkability. A long haul vintage.' - Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 95/100\n\u2018Distinctive, with singed iron and lilac hints, followed by a mix of boysenberry, blackberry and black currant fruit flavors. Dried star anise, cinnamon and black tea notes fill the finish, with iron-coated grip underneath. Tastes like a meeting of Cabernet and Nebbiolo. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2020. 1,500 cases imported.\u2019 \u2013 91/100 Wine Spectator (2015)\n\u2018Lively pencil lead, cocoa, oil and tar aromas \u2013 real sophistication with a flash of green character on the palate and pert tannins. Supreme length.\u2019 \u2013 Richard Hemming MW 17.5+/20, JancisRobinson.com ( 2018)\nSensational 2009 (92 pts), indisputably great vintage of venerable cab-dominated (70%) Bordeaux blend. Indulgently plush, with dark fruit that easily absorbs & integrates the oak influence (65% new barrels) to produce an impressively complex, densely structured & promising masterpiece. - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2014, 4.5*",
