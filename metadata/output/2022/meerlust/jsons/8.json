  "description": "*\u2018Big come-back for this pioneering \u201cBordeaux blend\u201d label, after a few good if not startling vintages in the early \u201880s, with majestic, fruity, tannic \u201886, \u201887 and next release \u201889, which should top them all. \u201889 towers above rest for sheer charm, plus firm drinkability. It combines rich, honest fruit, minerally complexity and backbone - the epitome of elegance in clean-cut, classic claret style. Aged 18 months to 2 years, mostly new oak (Nevers).\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1993/1994, 4.5\u2606\n\n Gold at 1995 International Wine Challenge.\n\n\nDecanter Magazine - \u201cTop Wines of the Year\u201d in 1997.\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
