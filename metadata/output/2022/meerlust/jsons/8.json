  "description": "\"Big come-back for this pioneering \"Bordeaux blend\" label, after a few good if not startling vintages in the early '80s, with majestic, fruity, tannic '86, '87 and next release '89, which should top them all. '89 towers above rest for sheer charm, plus firm drinkability. It combines rich, honest fruit, minerally complexity and backbone - the epitome of elegance in clean-cut, classic claret style. Aged 18 months to 2 years, mostly new oak (Nevers).\" - Platter's SA Wine Guide 1993/1994, 4.5* <br>Gold at 1995 International Wine Challenge.<br>Decanter Magazine - \"Top Wines of the Year\" in 1997.",
