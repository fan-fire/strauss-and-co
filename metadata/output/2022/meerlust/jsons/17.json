  "description": "\"For many - including followers abroad - this remains an ultimate name and statement in Cape claret style. The upcoming, rich cherry, chocolatey '95 due out in 2000, will be a serious collector's piece, matching the four finest years of the past decade or so - '86, '87, '89, '91.\" - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2000, 4* <p><br>This iconic vintage graced the back page of Decanter&rsquo;s magazine in 2000 with Michael Broadbent describing the vintage as &lsquo;One of the Cape&rsquo;s classics&hellip; Good fruit, lovely flavour and remarkably good value.&rsquo; In the same year Pierre Rovani reviewed the wine for The Wine Advocate, finding a cornucopia of fruits: &lsquo;It exhibits fabulous aromas of dark fruits, spices, and some candied strawberries. It has a lovely satiny structure, excellent focus, elegance, and is crafted in a feminine style. This concentrated, spicy, cherry and blackberry syrup-flavoured offering has an exceptional finish filled with plums and tangy blackcurrants.&rsquo;</p><p>Stored in professional cellaring since release, this is an extraordinarily rare investment opportunity to purchase a pristine 6-bottle case of arguably the greatest Rubicon vintage.</p>",
