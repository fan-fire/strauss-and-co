  "description": "Seal Code: 0745 - 070238\n\nThis iconic vintage graced the back page of Decanter\u2019s magazine in 2000 with Michael Broadbent describing the vintage as \u2018One of the Cape\u2019s classics\u2026 Good fruit, lovely flavour and remarkably good value.\u2019 In the same year Pierre Rovani reviewed the wine for The Wine Advocate, finding a cornucopia of fruits: \u2018It exhibits fabulous aromas of dark fruits, spices, and some candied strawberries. It has a lovely satiny structure, excellent focus, elegance, and is crafted in a feminine style. This concentrated, spicy, cherry and blackberry syrup-flavoured offering has an exceptional finish filled with plums and tangy blackcurrants.\u2019\nStored in professional cellaring since release, this is an extraordinarily rare investment opportunity to purchase a pristine 6-bottle case of arguably the greatest Rubicon vintage.",
