  "description": "\u2018Cape Bordeaux-style standard bearer, for nearly two decades now. But rarely thrusting, demonstrative. Meerlust has been - still is - reluctant to plunge headlong into New World fruitiness. French-speaking proprietor Hannes Myburgh, a \u201cgraduate\u201d of vintages at Ch\u00e2teau Lafite, values the European tradition of nuance and understatement, of finding beauty even in austerity. Dalla Cia does too. Quite beautiful, full and rounded for a claret style - even if perhaps not dense enough for out-and-out devotees of thick-textured Cabernet. It resonates with finely delineated fruit and spice.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1997, Best of the bunch. Superior Cape Wine. The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
