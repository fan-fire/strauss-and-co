  "description": "*'Dark ripe, cola and ribena. Quite round, soft, juicy and attractive. Nice balance of savoury and primary fruit. Pretty long and impressive. Drink now to 2030'* - Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100\n\n\n*'Superlative 2010 follows sensational 2009 (4.5 stars, 92 pts), maintains classicism of this flagship Cabernet-dominated (65%) Bordeaux blend. Plush, the dark fruit absorbs & integrates the oak influence (60% new, 21 months) within complex, dense structure. For the long haul.* '- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 5\u2606\n\n\n*'A good example of a modernised Cape classic, Rubicon is great to drink at five years and will mature well thereafter. Subtle oak, graphite, autumn leaves, cassis and fine-boned tannins: this wine is remarkably complex and a brilliant follow-up to the 2009. Drink: 2015-25* '- Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 94/100\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
