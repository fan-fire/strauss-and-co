  "description": "*\u2018Signature restraint in classic 2008 Cape Cabernet-based Bordeaux benchmark, though more accessible and expressive than particularly tight 2007 (5 stars). Boldly packed dense, dark fruit, seamlessly underpinned by lithe tannins, delivers harmonious, complete blend.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2013, 4.5\u2606\n\n*\u2018Complex, fresh, subtle nose. Lovely top note of something that adds some attractive greenness. Really appetising. Well done! Manages not to be too green\u2026\u2019* - Jancis Robinson MW, JancisRobinson.com, 17/20 (Jun 2014)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
