  "description": "\u2018Iconic claret-style red and one of SA\u2019s most famous wines. Longevity enhanced by major Cabernet Sauvignon component; 69% in 2003; Merlot and Cabernet Franc (19/12) in usual cohort roles. Captures vintage charm: elegantly expressive blackberry/cassis fruit, smoky oak accompaniment with hint clove. Seems more approachable than usual but has spine, confident frame for interesting development over several years. French oak, 80% new, for 20 months.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5\u2606 The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
