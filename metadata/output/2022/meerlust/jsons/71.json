  "description": "*'Really elegant with lovely depth and fine aromatics. Some toasty oak evident as well as slight sweet sour, savoury notes. Firm tannin and acidity with long finish. Drink now to 2030' -* Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 92/100\n\n\n*'Incredible purity. Completely open-knit and generous, but also beautifully elegant and appetising. Cherries, pomegranate, flint and pot-pourri perfume overlayed on a sleek palate. This is one of the underrated Cape vintages of the post-2000 era, revealing ever more composure and elegance with age. For those with preference of the less ripe vintages.'*\u00a0- Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 95/100\n\n\n*\u2018Superlative\u2019 & \u2018sensational\u2019 are common epithets for this flagship cab-dominated (\u00b160%) Bordeaux blend. Lithe 2013 & sleek 2012 take up the baton of 2010 (5 stars, 98 pts) after 2011 not made. Plush, the dark fruit integrates the oak influence (65% new, 20 months) within complex, dense structure. For the long haul.'*- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2017, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
