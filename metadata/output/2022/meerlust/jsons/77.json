  "description": "Seal Code: 7720 - 419653\n\n\u2018\u2018Superlative\u2019 and \u2018sensational\u2019 are common epithets for this flagship Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated (\u00b160%) Bordeaux blend. Lithe 2013 & sleek 2012 take up the baton of 2010 (5 stars, 98 pts) after 2011 not made. Plush, the dark fruit integrates the oak influence (65% new, 20 months) within complex, dense structure. For the long haul.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2017, 4.5*\n\u2018Meerlust\u2019s top red is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot as the chorus. It\u2019s a frm, serious, almost austere red that\u2019s clearly built to age. I\u2019d like a little more fruit on the tannic bones, but this is well made in a traditional style.\u2019 - Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2016, 90/100",
