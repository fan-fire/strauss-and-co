  "description": "\u2018A blend in the M\u00e9doc tradition, with Cabernet Sauvignon dominating and more Merlot than Cabernet Franc. The Merlot is an especially round, soft wine, and many connoisseurs have suggested that it be marketed on its own. But it plays a vital role in the blend, which has complexity, richness and perfumed breadth. The first release was an \u201880, but in the view of some experts, \u201881 is even better. Both are rated Superior.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 1985, 5\u2606\u00a0 The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
