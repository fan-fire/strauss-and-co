  "description": "\"One of the early Cape Bordeaux royals - now celebrating a quarter century. Regality evident in 2000's deep, polished robe; imposing yet unintimidating vinous m√©lange with cedary decoration. Sleek, agreeably fresh, medium-bodied. Present tannic grip suggests no problem 'losing' this for another 6 years. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc. 2 years in French oak, 80% new.\"  - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2005, 4.5*<p><em>&ldquo;<br>Deep purple ink colour. A spicy tobacco leaf and cigar box bouquet. Firm tannins, youthful palate. The wine is well-balanced and has good ageing potential.&rdquo;</em> - <strong>Best in Class Silver - International Wine and Spirits Competition ( IWCS ) 2005</strong></p>",
