  "description": "\"Remains among the top South African claret blends. A warm, full structure, more significantly oaked than in past vintages, exhibiting enough fruit, but not in any overstated plummy way, ending with firmness and lingering claret minerally strength. '87 is particularly concentrated. Consistently elegant style, medium-bodied, restrained but perfumed.\" Platter's SA Wine Guide 1991, 4.5* <br>\"What a treat when Chris Williams pulled out this 30-year-old example to show how well this moderately-priced (sic) wine ages. Such a depth of colour, but beautiful sweet fruit, there is truffle and sweet damp earth that is the tell-tale of its age, but it seems so youthful, still so densely fruited and tangy, with lots of cherry brightness. Not available retail, but pops up at auction occasionally.\" - Tom Cannavan, wine-pages.com, 94/100 (Jan 2019)",
