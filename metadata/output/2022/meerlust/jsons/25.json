  "description": "*'This is quite earthy and with morish decay on the nose. The palate is fresher with dense, chocolatey fruit. Maybe starting to dry out, with its tannic, chunky finish. Large format should last a decade longer and warrant a higher score. Drink now.' -* Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 90/100.\n\n\n\u2018*As flamboyant challengers \u2013 often laced with bulging ripe fruit and/or flagrant oak \u2013 come and go, this pre-eminent \u2018Cape claret\u2019, wih a two-decade bloodline, continues to hold court. Invariably fine-grained and classic; 99 dusty, cedar/tobacco notes, fruit still trussed up by lacy tannins Loaded with potential; needs at least a decade from harvest. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc; 2 yrs Fr (Nevers) oak, 80% new.\u2019*\u00a0\u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2004, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
