  "description": "\"Latest release of this Bordeaux-style blend - among first in the Cape with 1980. Remains true to type, elegant rather than showy, supple rather than bold. Touch uncharacteristic gaminess on nose.\" - Platter's SA Wine Guide 1996, 4* <br> \"Very fine wet earth complexity to begin, this wine is perfumed and intense showing saline cassis, iodine, briney oyster shell, sweet boxwood notes and complex hints of grilled herbs. The palate still shows such rich vibrancy, sweet black tea intensity, black currant coulis and a suave, creamy sweet tannin finish. So fresh, bright, pure, dense and utterly youthful! Lovely structure balanced by big concentration. Utterly spellbinding. Drink now to 2035+.\" - Greg Sherwood MW, Wine Safari, 96/100 (Jan 2018)",
