  "description": "\u2018*Elegant but not insubstantial, 04 is Chris Williams\u2019s debut with long-time Cape icon. 64% Cabernet Sauvignon; Merlot, Cabernet Franc. Silk rather than brocade; blackcurrant, raspberry notes deliver harmony, length and balance. 2 yrs oak, 80% new. Deserves cellaring.\u2019* \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2009, 4.5\u2606\n\n\n\u2018*Concentrated and grippy, with dark, roasted plum, black licorice, charcoal, mesquite and bittersweet cocoa notes. Traditional in vein, with an iron- and earth-filled finish that should soften nicely with cellaring. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.*\u2019 \u2013 90/100 Wine Spectator (2008)\n\n The wines will continue to be cellared at the Meerlust vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal. Rubicon is not produced every year. If a vintage is not produced, the NFT will include the next vintage, to total 50 consecutive vintages",
