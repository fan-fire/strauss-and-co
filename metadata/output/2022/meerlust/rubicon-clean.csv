Sensational 2009 (92 pts), indisputably great vintage of venerable cab-dominated (70%) Bordeaux blend. Indulgently plush, with dark fruit that easily absorbs & integrates the oak influence (65% new barrels) to produce an impressively complex, densely structured & promising masterpiece. - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2014, 4.5*",0,,"Seal Code: 6061 - 578847

'As expected, the highlight of the tasting. Pure and beguiling nose, with Bordeaux-like graphite and forest floor notes. Dense, rich, and structured with powerful yet lacy tannins. Fine balance with a serious demeanour. Drink 2025 to 2040.'- Roland Peens (Feb 2021), 95/100
'Expressive of the vintage, the 2009 shows more intensity and concentration of dark fruit, still very tightly packed. Hint of sweet mocha. Unwavering structure, although there is a sweetness and opulence to the fruit that allows drinkability. A long haul vintage.' - Higgo Jacobs (Feb 2021), 95/100
