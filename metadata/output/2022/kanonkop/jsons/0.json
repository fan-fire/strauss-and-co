  "description": "*\u2018Legend in its own time, Cape classic in its own right. Bordeaux-style blend from low-yielding 30-plus year old vines, usually 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% each Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Traditionally vinified in open fermenters, 2 years in new French oak. 2000 very ripe but strikingly balanced, wild-scrub/herbs folded with forest-floor fruit, plush yet lissome tannins button up the excitement to come from 2005 onwards.\u2019* - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide 2004, 4.5\u2606\n\n *\u2018Great character in this throwback wine, with a thicket of dark currant, blackberry, tar, beef, chestnut, mineral and sanguine flavors. Long finish is etched with bittersweet chocolate and another layer of really ripe blackberry fruit. Impressive.\u2019* - James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 92/100 (Apr 2004)\n\n*\u2018Great character in this throwback wine, with a thicket of dark currant, blackberry, tar, beef, chestnut, mineral and sanguine flavors.
