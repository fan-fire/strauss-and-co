  "description": "Intricate 2008 (69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot) is medium bodied yet intensely flavoured. Violets, ripe red and black berries, vanilla and pencil shavings on the nose; excellent fruit expression, fresh acidity, ever so fine tannins before saline finish. 2 years in French oak, 100% new.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2012, 4.5*\u2018Very classic and perhaps old fashioned in style but well made.\u2019\u00a0 Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 90/100",
