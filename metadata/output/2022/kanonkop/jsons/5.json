  "description": "\u2018The 2005 Paul Sauer offers an exuberant bouquet with dried prune, licorice, a touch of caramel and fig that just soars from the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with a harmonious, focused opening. The tannins lend the 2005 a firm structure, but there is plenty of fruit to back it up and the finish fans out with luscious licorice, sea salt and black fruits that linger. Superb. Drink 2014-2025.\u2019\u00a0- Neal Martin, Robertparker.com, 93/100 (2013)\n\u00a0\u2018Confident, refined 05, 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with equal Merlot and Cabernet Franc spent 2 years in new casks after traditional fermentation in open kuipe. Seductive cedar, spice and richly layered fruit will appeal to eager audience, as will plush, lengthy finish. 14.5% alc. 2008 Calyon trophy for 04.\u2019\u00a0- Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide, 4.5* (2009)",
