Winning aromas cedar, spice, subtle berry, leading to oaky palate a touch lighter, less fruit-substantial than usual, but promising useful development. Vinified traditionally, like all these, in open fermenters. 2 years in French oak.'* - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2008, 4.5\u2606\n\n *\u2018Luscious, full-bodied and sophisticated, this red blend starts with aromas of blackberry, anise and spice, followed by black frit, cedar, mocha and spice flavors.
