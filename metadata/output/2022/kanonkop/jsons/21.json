  "description": "Renowned as among the Cape\u2019s greatest reds. 2018 has 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Classic aromas cedar and cassis plus vanilla and tobacco from all-new oak. Fine wine, with less concentration and density than 2017 (5 stars, 98 pts), but some might even prefer its lighter, supple elegance.' - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2022, 4.5* (94/100)",
