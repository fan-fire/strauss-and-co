  "description": "\u2018Deep red-ruby. Pure, nuanced nose offers bitter cherry, plum, cedar, minerals and sweet tobacco; more complex and elegant than the straight cabernet. Then lush and smooth but at the same time vinous and penetrating, conveying an impression of strong extract. Not at all a sweet style despite its superripe berry flavors, but this is smooth, sappy and serious. Finishes with terrific length and verve, with lush, broad tannins. Very classy wine.\u2019 - Stephen Tanzer, Vinous, 92+/100 (Mar 2005) *\"Fine Bordeaux-style blend, one of few undoubted Cape classics - with recent years showing modern touches to classicism. Vinified traditionally in open fermenters. 01's 64% Cabernet less than usual 80%; with equal amounts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. From first sniff, obvious claims to illustrious lineage: violets, tea-leaf, blackberries, presented subtly and superbly. Finely structured and balanced palate, strongly elegant, with succulent acidity and silky tannins, plentiful understated fruit. 26 months new French oak will knit. Few more years will bring harmony, heralding rewarding lengthy maturity\"*\u00a0- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2005, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal.",
