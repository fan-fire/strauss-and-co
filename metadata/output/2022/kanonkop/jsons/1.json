  "description": "\"Fine Bordeaux-style blend, one of few undoubted Cape classics - with recent years showing modern touches to classicism. Vinified traditionally in open fermenters. 01's 64% Cabernet less than usual 80%; with equal amounts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. From first sniff, obvious claims to illustrious lineage: violets, tea-leaf, blackberries, presented subtly and superbly. Finely structured and balanced palate, strongly elegant, with succulent acidity and silky tannins, plentiful understated fruit. 26 months new French oak will knit. Few more years will bring harmony, heralding rewarding lengthy maturity\"\u00a0- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2005, 4.5*",
