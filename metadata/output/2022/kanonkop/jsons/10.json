  "description": "\u2018Thrilling return to form for iconic Bordeaux blend Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) and equal Merlot, Cabernet Franc. 2010 red and black fruit, incense on the nose, plenty of reined-in power on the palate. Great fruit definition, bright acidity, firm but fine tannins. 100% new oak, 26 months. Promises to give much pleasure in the future.\u2019 \u2013 Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide, 4.5* (2014)\n\u2018A direct beam of blackberry and black currant fruit is intertwined with savory, sanguine and lightly singed cedar notes. Shows good focus through the finish, where a perfumy rooibos tea accent lingers. Sneakily long and should unfold more in the cellar. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot.\u2019 \u2013 James Molesworth, Wine Spectator, 91/100 (Apr 2015)",
