  "description": " *'(68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% each Merlot and Cabernet Franc): Bright red-ruby. Enticing aromas of cassis, black cherry, licorice and wild herbs. Dense, layered and deep; at once ripe and dry, with rich, brooding flavors of cassis and cedary spices. This very concentrated, very tightly wound young wine boasts compelling inner-palate energy and finishes with terrific length. Sappy, structured and built to age. Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar.\u2019* \u2013 Stephen Tanzer, Vinous, 92+/100 (Sept 2012)\n\n\n\u2018*Features a core of dark plum, cassis and blackberry fruit offset by a floral anise notes. Delivers ample grip, but remains sleek and fine-grained, with a flicker of apple wood filling out the finish. Shows latent depth and should cellar nicely. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Best from 2014 through 2020.*\u2019 \u2013 Wine Spectator (October 2013), 92/100\n\n\n*\u2018At a time when a lot of the so-called old guard are rapidly being outpaced, outflanked by the new generation of winemakers who have travelled overseas and introduced a more thoughtful approach to their craft, Kanonkop are a testament to fact that some of the country\u2019s stalwarts can remain at the top of their game. Many producers merely pay lip service to the notion of finesse, but at Kanonkop that is evident where it matters \u2013 in the glass. So kudos to owners Johann and Paul Krige and especially to winemaker Abrie Beeslaar, installed at Kanonkop since 2002, for all their hard work. What I found interesting was Abrie\u2019s conviction that Kanonkop has remained true to what it does, ignoring fads and fashions, merely fine-tuning its style. I have to say that over the last ten years their wines have attained a greater degree of refinement and purity, therefore something must have changed! What distinguishes Kanonkop is both the enviable age of some of its vine stock, especially its Pinotage, and the corollary of longevity. These are wines that are probably drunk way too early by consumers, although I can understand why. Chuck two or three bottles in your cellar and leave them for 20 years \u2013 you will be amazed at what you will find.\u2019 -*Neal Martin, Wine Advocate, 93/100 (Oct 2013)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal.",
