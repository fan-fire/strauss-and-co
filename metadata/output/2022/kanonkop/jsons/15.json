  "description": "*A great wine, with a distinguished track record in one of the best-ever Cape vintages: if any South African wine deserves 100 points, and I strongly believe that it does, then it is the brilliant 2015 Paul Sauer, one of the greatest young wines I have ever tasted.\u2019*\u00a0 Tim Atkin SA Special Report 2018, 100/100\n\n\n*'Rightly regarded as SA \u2018first growth\u2019 Bordeaux blend, traditionally Cabernet-based with Merlot, Cabernet Franc; 70/15/15 in 2015 which, though less plush than 2014 in cooler summer, exudes a controlled opulence thanks to satisfying dry finish and firm tannic foundation for extended ageing.'* - Platter's SA Wine Guide 2019, 5\u2606 (95/100)\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal.",
