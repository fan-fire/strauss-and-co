  "description": "\u2018Always close to the top of the red Bordeaux style pile in South Africa, Paul Sauer is one of a handful of wines that is collectible, partly because of its track record, but also because it ages so well. This blend of Cabernet with 18% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot is aged entirely in new oak, but you\u2019d never know it, such is its grace and poise. Subtle, leafy, spicy and very fine. Drink: 2015-30.\u2019- Tim Atkin MW, SA Special Report 2015, 95/100\n\u2018Sense of place in this iconic flagship; richly vinous more than fruity, with supple muscularity. 2011 touch more aromatic in youth, with hint oak (new French); but firm underbelly, austere conclusion from its 70% Cabernet Sauvignon portends well for future. Cabernet Franc and Merlot complete blend.\u2019 - Platter\u2019s SA Wine Guide, 4.5* (2015)",
