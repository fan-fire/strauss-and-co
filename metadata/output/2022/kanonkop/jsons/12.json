  "description": "'This brilliant Bordeaux blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% each of Merlot and Cabernet Franc is always sourced from the same 40-year-old block on the farm. Leafy, floral and subtle, with notes of spice and cigar box, it carries its tannins lightly. A stunning Paul Sauer release. Drink: 2016-30' - Tim Atkin SA Wine Report 2016, 96/100\n'Cabernet-based flagship, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot. 2012 with usual richly vinous, muscular build; penetrating ripe fruit to balance concluding austerity. Beautifully composed, complemented by new oak, a long, fine future assured. '- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 4.5*",
