  "description": "*'This brilliant Bordeaux blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% each of Merlot and Cabernet* *Franc is always sourced from the same 40-year-old block on the farm. Leafy, floral and* *subtle, with notes of spice and cigar box, it carries its tannins lightly. A stunning Paul Sauer* *release. Drink: 2016-30*' - Tim Atkin SA Wine Report 2016, 96/100\n\n\n*'Cabernet-based flagship, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot. 2012 with usual richly vinous, muscular build; penetrating ripe fruit to balance concluding austerity. Beautifully composed, complemented by new oak, a long, fine future assured.* '- Platter's SA Wine Guide 2016, 4.5\u2606\n\n The wines will be cellared at Wine Cellar (Professional wine storage, Cape Town) vintage cellar until maturity (estimated 2028) or withdrawal.",
