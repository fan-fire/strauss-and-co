 ‘A classic since 1981: has Cape character plus international sophistication. Vinified traditionally, like all these, in open fermenters. 03’s 63% Cabernet Sauvignon in line with previous, but just 6% Merlot, rest Cabernet Franc. Dominated in youth by oak and spicy tobacco, but rich fruit lurking: deserves at least half-decade maturation for violets, tea-leaf, black berries to play full role within firm, ripe structure.’ – Platter’s SA Wine Guide 2007, 4.5*

Sweet, dense and silky, with highly concentrated candied fruit flavors and superb inner-palate verve. Complicating notes of tar and forest floor. Finishes firmly tannic and very long. An outstanding vintage for this South African classic. – Stephen Tanzer, Vinous,  92+/100 (March 2007)
‘The 2003 Kanonkop Paul Sauer Stellenbosch has the highest percentage of Cabernet Franc used to date (31%) with 6% Merlot and 63% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a very refined bouquet, very pure, with star-anise-tinged black fruit with hints of bell pepper and tertiary notes emerging with time. The palate has an understated entry with a slightly grainy texture: blackberry, black olive, a touch of menthol and dried orange rind toward the finish. This is drinking now, but will continue to evolve over 15 to 20 years.’ – Neal Martin, Wine Advocate (October 2014), 91/100

So kudos to owners Johann and Paul Krige and especially to winemaker Abrie Beeslaar, installed at Kanonkop since 2002, for all their hard work. What I found interesting was Abrie’s conviction that Kanonkop has remained true to what it does, ignoring fads and fashions, merely fine-tuning its style. I have to say that over the last ten years their wines have attained a greater degree of refinement and purity, therefore something must have changed! What distinguishes Kanonkop is both the enviable age of some of its vine stock, especially its Pinotage, and the corollary of longevity.
