  "description": "Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild is not only one of the finest Bordeaux wines, but it is also one of the world's greatest. The First Growth from Pauillac holds an incredible track record for the most consistent and long-lived wines in all of Bordeaux. It can be argued that the modern age of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild arose along with the modernization of the entire Bordeaux wine region.\n\nEach year since 1945, the Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild label has been illustrated with an artwork by a leading painter, specially created for the vintage. Thus, the most famous names in contemporary painting have been brought together in a collection to which a new work is added each year. From one label to another, Mouton Rothschild has thus brought together some of the most celebrated artists of their day, including Mir\u00f3, Chagall, Braque, Picasso, T\u00e0pies, Francis Bacon, Dali, Balthus, Jeff Koons and even Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales. The artists have complete freedom of creation, though certain themes, such as the vine, the pleasure of drinking and the ram, the Mouton Rothschild emblem, have proved a particularly rich source of inspiration.\n\nThe code for this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fan-fire/strauss-and-co). Note that the tokens in this collection serve as a [basket](https://github.com/fan-fire/NFB) where each basket owns all the underlying tokens for each estate, and only the owner of the basket can open and remove wines from the basket.
