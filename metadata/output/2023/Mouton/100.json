    "description": "Label art by Balthus - the dreamy adolescent girl, wilful, graceful and fragile...All the hypnotic power of style that is both limpid and full of mystery, leading us away to distant lands of fantasy and desire. The pencil drawing of a nude reclining nymphet was rejected for use in the United States by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,as such, for the U.S. market the label was made with a blank space where the image should have been and both versions are sought after by collectors.",
