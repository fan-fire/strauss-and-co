    "description": "In 1945, to commemorate the Allied victory, Baron Philippe de Rothschild had the idea of embellishing the Mouton Rothschild label with art-work: in this instance, a symbolic return of peace. He commissioned this from young unknown artist, Philippe Jullian. Having displayed early promise as a designer. This label is based on the famous 'V for Victory' that Churchill used throughout the war to rally the forces of freedom.",
