    "description": "For the year 2000, which celebrates the new millennium, Baroness Philippine de Rothschild did not commission a painter. In fact, the bottle itself is a collector\u2019s item for this year. The glass is adorned with a treasure from the Museum of Wine in Art at Mouton: the little \u201cAugsburg Ram\u201d. The ram is the estate\u2019s symbol and is in the family crest. The estate called the glass manufacturer B.S.N. for this special edition with a new technique of enameling in relief. A golden ring around the black foil mimics the design engraved on the ram\u2019s collar and recalls the chased volutes of its body. As a proof of authenticity the Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild name is engraved in the base.",
