    "description": "Label art by Marc Chagall - Synthesis of the Jewish and Russian cultural traditions, half-realistic, half-symbolic Rather than wine, it was the living fruit of the vine, speared by a thrush or fed by a mother to her child. The 1970 vintage took second place, and was the highest ranked French wine, at the historic 1976 Judgment of Paris wine competition.",
